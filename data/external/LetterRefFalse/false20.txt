Where are you going , Tony ?  It's none of your business .  Mom said you couldn't go out .  I'm going out anyway . Get out of my way . 
Has someone already helped you ?  No , not yet . I'd like to buy a teapot .  Which do you like best ?  That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ?  360 yuan .  Show it to me , Please . Can you get me another ? It's scratched a little bit here .  Sorry , sir . This is the last one we have in stock .  I do like it . Can you come down a bit ?  I can give you a 10 % discount .  That's still too much . Can you lower the price further ?  I'm afraid that's the best we can do .  If so , I'd better try another store . 
So how far is the museum , dad ?  It is about 10 minutes walk .  Finish your hot chocolate and we will go .  Are we going to come back here for lunch ?  No , we will have lunch at the museum cafeteria .  I have finished . We can go now .  Let's go then . On the way we have to turn right and right again at the next junction .  Let's stop at the newsagent , I would like to buy a newspaper . We can also buy postcards for your friends .  Can you see a Post Office somewhere around here ?  Yes it is down there , at the end of the road , next to the supermarket .  Oh good we are almost there . The museum is round the corner from the Post Office . 
I need some flowers for my girlfriend .  No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ?  Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant . Artificial flowers have no passion .  How much did you want to spend ?  Money is no object .  Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily .  I will take ten .  Do you want to add some baby's breath for that ? They are equally popular now .  Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ?  Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge .  That's ok . Here is the address . 
What can I do for you ?  Can I have a look at your handworks ?  All right . This way , please .  You have quite a range , haven't you ?  Yes , sir .  They are all produced in China , aren't they ?  Yes , they are all distinctive Chinese .  Could you please select me one ?  How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful .  Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ?  350 yuan .  OK . I'll take it . 
Dad , do you know where Mom is ?  I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you .  She'd better not start crying like she usually does .  I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ?  Dad , now don't you go getting mush on me .  I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world .  That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks .  We have great confidence in you . 
Mom , look ! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it !  That is a blast from the past .  Remember when I used to beg you to break it so I could go buy ice cream ?  Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars .  Thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom .  But what are you going to do with that pig ?  I think I'm going to keep it as a monument to what I've learned about money .  Who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation ! 
Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets .  It still feels really strange to me .  I know . I miss him terribly .  How does it feel to be in charge of so much money ?  I thought I would feel like I was in the lap of Luxury .  I guess you could choose that if you wanted .  No , I think I will run things much the same way that Dad did .  Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone ! 
Do I have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ?  No , you do not have to . The handbag can be taken with you . There is the cart at the entrance .  Thank you . I'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby . Is there anything that you can recommend for me ?  Well , how old is your baby ?  No more than three .  The milk powder on the second level of the shelf is for the kids from 2 ages to 4 ages . I advice that you should buy the Wyeth brand , the source of milk is imported from New Zealand .  How about its quality ?  You can be assured of it . There are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies ' bone and cerebrum .  OK , what is this ?  It is feeding-bottle as the free gift .  It is thoughtful . I will take it . 
We will go to climb up the hill tomorrow . Let's go to supermarket to buy some food .  Yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill .  What should we buy ?  Let me see . We should go to buy some fruit first .  It is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top .  How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it .  Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children .  Yes . Look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ?  That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks .  Definitely beer . Two bottles .  Right . We should buy some yoghurt for kids .  Yes . Shall we buy some saucers ? It will be used during our picnic .  OK . Four saucers . We can buy some custard tarts tomorrow morning .  Let's go to queue up . There are so many people in the lines . 
Can I help you ?  I need some stamps .  What kind of stamps do you want ?  How much do I need for this letter ?  I must weigh it .  How much ? Is it overweight ?  It is 5 grams overweight . Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ?  How much is it , then ?  Registration plus overweight , 7 yuan in all .  OK . Here you are . 
Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ?  Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now .  Wow . You look great .  Thanks for noticing .  What type of diet were you on ?  I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months .  That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ?  Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day .  That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ?  Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate .  That makes sense . I'm going to try that .  You don't need to lose weight .  I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of .  Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet .  Thanks for the advice .  No problem . 
Nancy , please turn the TV down .  Come on , John . This is my favorite show .  I don't care . I have a headache . 
I'm sleepy . I can hardly keep my eyes open .  Why don't you go to bed ?  I think I will . 
Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ?  I think he hasn't made any new friends yet . He's just a little lonely .  He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood .  Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him .  How do you propose to help him understand that ?  Well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends .  I guess we could go visit once in a while too .  Yeah . There's a lot we can do to help him through this transition . 
Oops !  What happened ?  I overcooked the corn .  That's okay . I like it better that way anyway . 
I'm freezing . Turn down the air conditioner , will you ?  But then it'll be too warm .  Not if you take off your jacket . 
Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner .  No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ?  I don't think so . Do you remember Bob Gain from Tulsa ?  That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more .  He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day .  Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake .  You're glad he saved me , huh ?  Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time ! 
Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet .  Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet .  Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight .  That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem .  What do you know ? You are over weight too .  I'm not on a diet though .  I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight .  I like ice cream too much though .  C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there .  It does sound appealing .  It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .  Okay . I'm in . Let's do it .  Great . I'll get our plan started right away .  Can we start tomorrow though ? 
I need to buy some fruit .  All the fruit are pretty fresh here .  How much are the pears ?  They're four yuan per kilo .  Give me one kilo of those , please . Do you have any fresh plums ?  Yes , we do . They are eight yuan per kilo .  It's a bit too expensive . We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here .  Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo .  Sounds reasonable . I'll take three kilos .  OK . It's 22 yuan  Here you are .
