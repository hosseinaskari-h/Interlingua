Excuse me . I get confused that the two phones on the booth are different , can you tell me how to use them ?  Let me have a look . Oh , yes . This one is the IC phone and the other is the coin phone . If you have an IC card , you can insert it into this slot , wait for the dialing signal appearing on the small screen , and then dial the number of the person you are going to call .  Well , I see . How to use the other one ?  First , you pick up the receiver , wait for the dialing signal , dial the number , and then put the coin into the slot , press the ' speak ' button . Then everything is done .  It seems quite easy . I will try both of them .
