I have lots of work to do . What ’ s more , my grandma is ill .  I am sorry to hear that , but face the music . 
I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday .  Dear , let ’ s drop the subject . 
I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now !  I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself . 
Could you do me a favour ? Please give me some confidential information .  Don ’ t put me on the spot . You know , I can ’ t do that . 
Honey , please forgive me . There is lots of work to do . So , I forget your birthday .  I see.That ’ s all right . Don ’ t put the blame on yourself . 
Although you spare no effort to complete the project . I think you have missed the boat .  I will not miss the boat when there is another opportunity again next time . 
I ’ m deeply grateful for all you ’ Ve done .  You ’ re welcome . I enjoyed helping you . 
Don't worry , your baby is in my home .  How can I ever thank you ? I owe you a big favor . 
Why aren ’ t they are aware of the gravity of the situation ?  Because they are rednecks . 
I am sorry . I didn ’ t accomplish the job on time .  That ’ s all right . Everyone feels under the weather sometimes . Just finish the rest when you feel well . 
I will take part in the finals soon .  Come on . I stand behind you . 
I am sorry to make you run down to the office for me .  No trouble . I enjoyed helping you . 
Thank for your help . I owe you .  No sweat ! Think nothing of it . 
Thank you . You do me a big favor .  That was a cake walk.It ’ s nothing to speak of . 
I firmly believe that if we invested in funds we could earn a lot of money .  All wet.You are such a fool . 
Look ! It fits you perfectly . It looks great on you and has your name on it .  Really ? What about your opinion , Daniel ? 
You have always got your nose in the air , which hurts many boys ’ hearts .  I am afraid not . I have no interest in them at all . 
Look over there . That is what I am looking for . Let's go !  I want to see you play . Be quick !  Don ’ t chicken out ! Come on ! 
I ’ m so surprised to meet you in this remote village . Long time no see .  Yeah . How are you these days ? 
What ’ s up ? You look so blue .  Unfortunately , I missed a chance to see a classic movie .
