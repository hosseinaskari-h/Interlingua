do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ?  yes , I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ?  I was at home with my parents in New York City .  really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ?  I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building .  that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ?  no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos .  did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ?  yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers .  did he survive ?  unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower .  I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family .  it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own .  terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life . 
have you read the feature article about Oprah Winfrey in this magazine ?  no , what's it about ?  apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity .  she's very generous with her money . I think that's because she was poor when she was young .  I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world .  I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base .  you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa .  did they mention that in the article ?  yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary .  that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has .  I agree . So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels .  it's amazing how much money they can spend . I heard Britney Spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room !  what a waste . It's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols . 
did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?  no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .  yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .  they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .  they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .  I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .  did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?  I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .  Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?  yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .  I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .  people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .  I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .  that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .  thank goodness we're not rich and famous !  being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . 
the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !  exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .  on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .  as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .  I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse  what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?  it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .  I see , so it's similar to global warming ?  they're related to one another , yes .  I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .  people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .  people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .  I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . 
what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ?  I never really give them money because I don't want to contribute to their addictions .  homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . Do you do anything to help them ?  I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat . I figure that if they're homeless , they're probably hungry .  that's a good idea . Do they usually accept the food ?  almost always . However , sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash .  it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now .  the cost of living in London is just too high for most people .  it's true . The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment .  did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage , let alone pay for food and other living costs ?  there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around . If only the housing cost would drop , fewer people would be in financial trouble .  added to that is the high unemployment rate right now .  something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon .  politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class . They like to focus on making life easier for the upper class .  I can only hope that one day they will change . 
what happened ? Why didn't he win ?  didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .  how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !  if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .  what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?  he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .  I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .  they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .  that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .  I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !  regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .  I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .  let's hope so . 
what are you watching on the telly ?  there's a great sitcom on Channel 3 that stars in about three minutes .  which one is that ?  the office . Have you watched it ?  I've seen the British version and loved it , but have never seen the American version .  it's almost exactly the same . I think it's a hilarious show .  what are you watching now ?  they're just showing highlights of American Idol from last night right now .  I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated .  I couldn't agree with you more .  have you got satellite , cable , or digital TV ?  we have digital TV . It's amazing though---even with 100 channels , there's often nothing on that I'd want to watch !  do you watch a lot of TV then ?  I guess so . I'm bit of a couch potato . How about you ?  I don't have a TV at home , so I rarely watch anything . Is there anything worth watching after the office ?  there's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that I'd like to watch . Do you want to stay and watch it with me ?  why not ? I don't have anything better to do ! 
so , are you enjoying the performance so far ?  well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ?  I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though .  do you know anyone in the play ?  actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine .  really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ?  that's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great .  so you've seen other plays that he's directed ?  quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ?  sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ?  I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school .  what did you do ?  I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ?  I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much .  why not ?  I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat .  that sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . 
have you ever been in an earthquake ?  yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .  do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ?  I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ?  no , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger .  where are you from ?  I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes .  did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?  most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .  wow , that must have really been scary .  actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .  have you ever experiences a flood ?  no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car !  that sure didn't last long ! 
did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ?  why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .  well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .  do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?  no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .  it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .  religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .  what do you think about abortion ?  I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .  do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?  I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .  why not ? It's their children , too .  that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .  that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . 
Guess what ! I know something you don't know !  What's that ?  How many planets are there in the solar system ?  That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nice .  Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore !  Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know .  I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore .  That sounds crazy . They can't just change their mind about things like that .  Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat .  I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around .  We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos .  Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ?  I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way .  Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ?  I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on Earth .  You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country !  Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . 
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?  while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .  why not ?  the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !  it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .  I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .  I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .  all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .  perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .  I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .  that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .  you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . 
have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ?  I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table .  you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish .  who's the director ?  it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ?  yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ?  sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now .  that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?  no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .  how much does the magadize cost ?  it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .  that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ?  Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .  I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine ! 
guess what ? I've got great news !  what is it ?  well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?  yes .  well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .  really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?  she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .  wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?  it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .  are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?  yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !  do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?  I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you .  I'm really looking forward to reading your column .  me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?  sure , where would you like to go ?  perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop . 
how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ?  I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me .  do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ?  I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ?  I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! 
it's a lovely day out today , isn't it ?  it's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow .  what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?  it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain .  that doesn't sound pretty .  do you have any plans for tomorrow ?  well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends .  you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery .  I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ?  I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .  if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !  if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .  that sounds like fun .  hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle !  English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought . 
do you have any plans for tomorrow night ?  not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ?  sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ?  have you heard of Hot Fuzz ?  yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ?  that's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ?  to be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best .  what do you have in mind ?  I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster .  isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ?  yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ?  not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ?  It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ?  Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen .  that sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ?  it's on at 8: 00 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time .  great . Shall I meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night ?  sounds good . I'll see you then ! 
so , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ?  yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all .  that's the Return of the King , right ?  yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ?  I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me .  did you read the books before you watched the movies ?  no . did you ?  yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters .  yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me .  I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home .  most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles .  that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries .  I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars .  actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! 
are your ready to go to the supermarket ?  yes , are you ?  I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready .  you do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you .  it wasn't cold out this morning .  well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there !  well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well .  have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ?  it does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .  that's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it .  ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here .  how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?  I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night .  maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse .  I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?  good idea . That will help us to warm up .  if I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me .  alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . 
Do you have any more questions ?  No , sir .  Let's call it a day then.Good - bye , everyone .  Good-bye , sir
