I ’ m betting the New York Yankees win . How about you ?  Well , I ’ m favor of the Red Sox . They ’ Ve had a good season .  Sorry , guys . Could I just interrupt for a moment ? My money is on the Yankees !  That ’ s not a very good pick . I ’ m against the Yankees .  Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox .  Yeah , I ’ m with you on that . 
what did you do over the weekend ?  I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .  do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?  it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .  like what ?  well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .  what else can we do to protect the environment ?  if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy .  how about recycling ? Does that actually help ?  yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center .  what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ?  I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .  I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before !  to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . 
Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ?  Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 .  Would you take $ 12 ?  No , I can ’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ?  13.50 ?  Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go . 
I have never experienced a roller coaster . I want you to sit beside me .  Wait a moment , I want to go to the toilet .  You try to put on a brave face . 
We have waited for a long time . When will we start ?  Take it easy . I have to cut my losses . 
Nice dress . How do I look ? Be honest .  Hmm ... you look too dressed up . How about this purple top and these jeans ?  Well , that top is a little too tight , and those jeans aren ’ t dressy enough . And I don ’ t feel comfortable with that . What do you think , Vicky ? You ’ Ve been very quiet up to now .  Be confident . Wear styles you ’ re going to be comfortable in . 
I am sorry . I ’ Ve left my disk at home .  Thank you all the same . 
I have failed in my final examination . What can I do now ?  You have asked me several times about it . You are driving me up the wall . 
Where is my contract ?  It ’ s all my faults . I forget where I put it . 
You know them ?  No , but those guys like to hit on me . 
Mom , can you talk about the philosophy of life with me ?  You got me on that one . 
Look , Bob . This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia .  Let me see it , can I ? This is a good photograph . Who are these people ?  They ’ re people I met during the trip . That ’ s the ship we traveled on .  What a beautiful ship ! Who ’ s this ?  That ’ s the man I told you about . Remember ?  Ah yes . The one who offered you a job in Australia .  That ’ s right .  Who ’ s this ?  Guess !  It ’ s not you , is it ?  That ’ s right . I grew a beard during the trip , but I shaved it off when I came home .  Why did you shave it off ?  My wife didn ’ t like it ! 
Hello , Ken .  Hello , George .  Have you just been to the cinema ?  Yes , I have .  What ’ s on ?  Paris in the Spring .  Oh , I ’ Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ’ s an old film , but it ’ s very good .  Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?  Yes , I have . I was there in April .  Paris in the spring , eh ?  It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .  Just like dear old London ! 
Why don ’ t you introduce him ? I wonder if we will become good friends .  He is the guy I was telling you about . 
Can you recognize that woman , Millie ?  I think I can , Kate . It must be Karen Marsh , the actress .  I thought so . Who ’ s that beside her ?  That must be Conrad Reeves .  Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ?  No , He must be her fourth or fifth .  Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old !  She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty .  I ’ m sure she is .  She was a famous actress when I was still a schoolgirl .  That was a long time ago , wasn ’ t it ?  Not that long ago ! I ’ m not more than twenty-nine myself . 
Do you like this dress , madam ?  I like the colour very much . It's a lovely dress , but it's too small for me .  What about this one ? It's a lovely dress . It's very smart . Short skirts are in fashion now . Would you like to try it ?  All right . I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well . It's smaller than the blue one . I don't like the colour either . It doesn't suit me at all . I think the blue dress is prettier . Co  I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress . This is the largest dress in the shop . 
Where do you come from ?  I come from England .  What's the climate like in your country ?  It's mild , but it's not always pleasant.The weather's often cold in the North and windy in the East . It's often wet in the West and sometimes warm in the South .  Which seasons do you like best ?  I like spring and summer . The days are long and the nights are short . The sun rises early and sets late . I don't like autumn and winter . The days are short and the nights are long . The sun rises late 
What seems to be the problem ?  Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed .  What ? You've got to be kidding me !  I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week .  Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner .  Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional .  I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ?  Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring  I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction .  That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters . 
I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ?  Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire .  Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?  We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .  I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?  Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .  It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .  Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days . 
Where do you come from ?  I come from Greece .  What's the climate like in your country ?  It's very pleasant .  What's the weather like in spring ?  It's often windy in March . It's always warm in April and May , but it rains sometimes .  What's it like in summer ?  It's always hot in June , July and August . The sun shines every day .  Is it cold or warm in autumn ?  It's always warm in September and October . It's often cold in November and it rains sometimes .  Is it very cold in winter ?  It's often cold in December , January and February . It snows sometimes .
