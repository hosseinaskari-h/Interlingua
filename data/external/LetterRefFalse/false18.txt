Honey , I think I need to go see the doctor .  Ah ! You're bleeding all over ! What happened ?  I was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw .  Here , use this rag to apply pressure to the cut . Does it hurt ?  No , not really , there's just a lot of blood .  You may just need stitches . I think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the ER . Let me make a quick phone call .  I'm going to go sit in the car while I still have the stomach to walk .  Oh , sorry ! I forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood . I'll be right there .

Bob , would you come and help me ?  Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ?  Could you hold these packages while I look for the key ?  Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy !  Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow .  Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy .  I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it .  Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ?

Mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ?  Everything about them was different , even the theaters .  I'm really interested . Tell me about them .  Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family .  That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food .  We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie .  Why don't we do that anymore ?  Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot . 
Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ?  Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content .  Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?  Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .  I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .  Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .  Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .  Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't . 
( A stranger stops to help ) Everything OK ?  No ! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . Now my engine is on fire !  I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated .  Do you know a lot about cars ?  A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to .  Please . Thank you so much for stopping .  Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard .  That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket .  Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car !  You do ?  I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal .  I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .  Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?  What kind of deal ?  I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .  You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?  I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .  If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?  Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany .  It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car ! 
Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ?  I did . Why ?  Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?  No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again . 
I'm going crazy .  What's the matter ?  I've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately .  Well , if there is anything I can do to help , let me know . 
Is there anything I can do for you ?  I'm trying to choose a gift .  Did you have anything particular in mind ?  No , but I'd like to get something typical in this region .  Well , we have some handmade products . Let me show you some .  They're quite nice . But I'm afraid they're quite a bit expensive .  About how much were you planning to spend ?  No more than one hundred yuan .  Oh , in that case . This one is OK .  Oh ! It's perfect . I think I'll take it . Would you wrap it , please ?  OK . Wait for a moment , please . 
This is the house I want to rent .  Could you tell me the advantages of it ?  No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient .  There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ?  200 dollars per week .  In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .  It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .  Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself .  Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ?  I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?  Twice a week for work and once for shopping .  In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .  That's true . Ok , I will think about it .
