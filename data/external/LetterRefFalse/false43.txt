Steven , I am ready for breakfast .  OK . But where is my favorite coffee ?  It's in that pan there . Your boy Dean broke the silex yesterday , so I have to boil it in the pan .  It tastes like crankcase oil , but delicious .  That's good . You can make breakfast yourself if you don't like it .  What is there besides coffee ?  I warmed a couple of snails , and your eggs are in the frying pan .  Oh , my God . It's nearly eight , I have no time to have breakfast now . My watch says seven fifty .  Don't worry . It's only ten to seven . You must have forgotten to set your watch back .  Yes , it was . The clock on the wall says eight to seven .  Yeah . Keep on eating your breakfast . You can catch the early bus .  Gee . I could have slept another hour .

And I would like to make dumplings later .  Yeah , you are my good helper , Steven .  Absolutely . 
Darling , I am back . What are you doing ?  I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows )  B , should we get a maid ?

You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself .  Give me some time to think about it . 
What do you think of this coffee table ?  It's nice , but it doesn't match the color of our room .  How about this one ?  Oh no , this type gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean .

I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ?  Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .  Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .  What about cats ? They are more independent .  Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .  How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?  Yeah , are they easy to look after ?  Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
