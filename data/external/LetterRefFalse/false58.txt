have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?  yeah , almost . But there is one thing .  what ?  I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ...  what is it ?  some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .  that makes you feel uncomfortable ?  yeah . we never do that in a public office .  perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .  i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .  well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .  just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?  yeah .  Oh , I'm shocked . 
hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ?  not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .  why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .  I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !  Really ? What's the series about ?  well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .  it sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .  I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .  really ? that's interesting !  yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .  OK , I'll give it a go . 
have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?  sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .  as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?  to begin with , I have to use chopsticks .  but you look quite proficient in using them now .  certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch  yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i  anything strang about that ?  maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .  oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . 
I heard that ben is forming his own band .  it will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist .  can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band .  I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band .  I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music .  nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don ’ t need to be able to play musical instrument or sing .  I'd love to try it.but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice .  you know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music .  that ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . 
I heard you received a prize for you book .  yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards .  congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement .  actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus .  what was the prize ?  I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice .  that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! Have you ever won a prize before ?  I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz .  I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! 
what kind of music do you like listening to ?  I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it ’ s too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ?  yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work .  I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music .  classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better .  really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress .  yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework .  I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power .  you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them .  that ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier .  that ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . 
do you like animals ? I really like dogs .  so do i . I don ’ t like cats .  why ? I think cats are ok .  I can ’ t bear being near cats . They don ’ t seem to like me either .  I like wild animals . I don ’ t like spiders and snakes . I think spiders and snakes are disgusting .  I ’ m fond of snakes . I think they ’ re great . I agree with you about spiders though . I think spiders are horrible . I think it ’ s because they have so many legs .  I think bears are wonderful . Pandas are fantastic . I low the people who kill them for their fur .  I agree . I ’ m carry about mice . I think they ’ re so cute !  really ? I don ’ t see the attraction . I ’ m afraid of mice . 
are you good at making decisions ?  not really . Sometimes , I even let other people make key decision for me .  what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ?  there are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to . I can never seem to choose . I let my parents make big decisions for me . They chose my university and my course . I ended up studying something  your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren ’ t careful ! Why don ’ t you try being more decisive ? Start with some basic ones . When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at , mak  that ’ s a good idea . You ’ re very decisive , I ’ Ve noticed . So , which bar are we going to this evening ?  I can ’ t make a decision . You ’ ll have to put forward an idea .  ok , i choose luckies .  you see ? You ’ re becoming more decisive already ! 
I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth .  let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance .  I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people .  you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .  I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense .  we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .  that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?  that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .  I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .  the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how . 
I ’ m looking forward to relaxing this coming weekend .  I hope that I can finally find free time too . I ’ Ve been so busy at work recently .  How might you spend the weekend .  I hope to do a little gardening . I find it very relaxing .  I might do that too . I hope the weather is nice . I could go and play some golf .  I heard that the weather should be good . There ’ s a possibility of a shower , but it ’ s not very likely .  Hopefully , we ’ ll both have relaxing weekends .  Of course , something could come up and stop that wish coming true .  Unfortunately , there ’ s always the possibility of some urgent work requiring our attention . 
I heard that janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I hear that they pay very well .  I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her .  now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states .  yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper .  you ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ?  really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago .  they did . He inherited the money form an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government .  dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ?  he said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires .  I had some good financial news yesterday too .  really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ?  no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way .  It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ? 
How are the children doing at sport ?  I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age .  He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?  He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi  Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?  The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .  How are they at swimming ?  They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .  Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .  I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !  I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .  It seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further . 
how do you usually spend your day , now that you ’ Ve retired ?  well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer that in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up .  what do you have for breakfast ?  I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast .  that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ?  I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about  how do you spend your afternoons ?  I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time 
I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features .  Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed .  Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them .  Is that type of plant found in this country ?  No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action .  So would i . what other unusual plants did they show ?  They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect molle  That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too .  That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species .  I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions .  According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation .  That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . 
Which sports are popular in your country ?  Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball .  Do many people like tennis ?  More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit .  In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them .  Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf .  I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played .  A great deal of people follow rugby in my country .  There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . 
Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ?  It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent .  It seems that the climate in this country is changing .  The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds .  I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment .  I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem .  Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . 
Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ?  There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers .  Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa .  Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food .  What is the international community doing to help ?  The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region .  How many countries have been affected ?  Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries .  I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran .  Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u  Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ?  So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . 
I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning .  Yesterday morning was beautiful i thought the sunning was going to continue .  So did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon.it was raining cats and dogs .  I know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm.it was pouring with rain all afternoon .  We really have some miserable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round .  If it was sunning all year round there would be drought.you probably would not like it either .  I guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable .  The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like.our weather is so changeable . 
Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine .  It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important .  What methods do you use to conserve water ?  Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water .  I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .  Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .  We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .  The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it .  I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . 
What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ?  I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor .  Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops .  What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet .  We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .  That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals .  I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways .  I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced .  That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well .  Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare .  Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals .  Yes , I have . They do an excellent job .
