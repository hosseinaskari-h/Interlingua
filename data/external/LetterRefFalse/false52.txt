have you ever been to Disneyworld ?  when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?  the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .  that's right . Why do you ask ?  well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .  when are you getting married ?  some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .  congratulations ! I had no idea .  thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?  do you like amusement parks ?  for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .  if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .  even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?  even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .  thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .  I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! 
Jack and Mary broke up .  it ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ?  Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , Mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .  really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ?  no , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time .  maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .  how so ?  he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them .  poor Mary ! She really liked him .  anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better .  do you think they ’ ll get back together ?  no , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind .  I hope she ’ ll recover soon .  so do I . 
how do you usually get to school ?  I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ?  I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car .  I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution !  I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient .  cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment .  do you have a car ?  no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it .  maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it .  you could try . It would save you a lot of money .  that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs .  if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too !  I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere !  let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .  sounds good ! Let's go ! 
this is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up .  are you serious ?  yes , I mean it .  but why ? Did I do anything wrong ?  no , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working .  hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things .  I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us .  but I still love you .  I ’ m sorry .  I knew this would happen some day ...  then why didn ’ t you talk to me ?  well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ...  I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends .  I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit .  I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart .  shall we keep Our friendship ?  sure , let ’ s just be friends . 
hello , Deva , how are you ?  can't complain . What about you ?  not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ?  I've heard . She looks quite depressed .  Yes . They used to be joined at the hip .  I heard they were just married for 5 months .  yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things .  yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden .  you said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage .  maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married .  yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners .  definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce .  we've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners .  that's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . 
what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ?  it's Beethoven . Do you like it ?  I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ?  I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax .  what other kind of music do you listen to ?  actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ?  to be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me .  what kind of music do you prefer then ?  I like pop music . Do you ?  not really . I don't think pop music has much depth .  I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .  how long have you been in to pop music , then ?  I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ?  not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all .  so , how did you become interested in it ?  well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started .  do you still play piano ?  yes , it's one of my hobbies . 
do you have any plans for Friday night ?  I don't think so . Why ?  well , my hosue-mates and I are having a house-warming party . Would you like to come ?  sure . Would it be alright if I brought a few friends ?  the more , the merrier !  will there be a lot of people there ?  I sure hope so . We've each invited about 10 people .  who else is going to be there ?  I'm inviting my friends from work , you , my sister , and a few friends from school .  I know your sister . She's very nice .  don't worry.You won't be sitting there by yourself .  what time is it going to start ?  most people are working Friday night , so it's going to start around 9 pm .  should I bring anything ?  we'll have beer and snacks , but if you want to bring a bottle of wine , that'd be great .  I could also bring some music if you want . I've got loads of songs on my new iPod .  that'd be great . I'll see you then ! 
hi , come on in . Can I take your coat ?  sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well .  you're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink .  should I take my shoes off ?  whatever you prefer .  this is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ?  just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ?  sure , what do you have ?  I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite .  I'll have a glass of red wine please .  one glass of red wine coming up !  so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ?  there's just going to be 6 of us tonight .  oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ?  Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well .  that's too bad.They ' re such good company .  I think there's someone at the door .  excuse me while I go and get that . 
Hi , chary , are you busy this evening ?  sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight .  what are you doing ?  I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday .  how old is he today ?  it's his 50th birthday .  well , wish him a happy birthday for me .  sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ?  I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .  well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then .  sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night .  sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us .  sounds that way . Maybe some other time then ?  sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going .  yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move .  say hello to your friends for me .  likewise . See you later .  Bye ! 
how's it going ?  I'm in a really good mood , actually . How about you ?  to be honest , I'm a bit fed up .  what's wrong ?  well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did .  that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it .  the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't .  I see how that can get a bit annoying .  a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar .  so what are you going to do about it ?  I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him .  what do you think would make you happier ?  in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first .  relationships can be confusing sometimes .  what would you do if you were me ?  I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him ! 
so ... what kind of things do you do in your free time ?  I'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ?  I like to do just about anything outdoors . Do you enjoy camping ?  camping for an evening is ok , but I couldn't do it for much longer than one night !  have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters ?  no , but I've always wanted to do that . I've heard it's a beautiful place to go .  it's fantastic . My family and I are very fond of the place .  do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there ?  sure , would you like to see them ?  that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ?  I have a Canon SLR .  so , you must be pretty interested in photography then .  I'd call it one of my hobbies . Do you know much about photography ?  actually , I do . I took quite a few photography classes at University .  have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ?  yes , I was planning on going . Are you ?  yes.In fact , maybe we could go together .  that'd be great . what time should I meet you there ?  how about at 11:00 ?  sounds great . see you then . 
why are you in such a good mood today ?  well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights .  I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ?  let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down .  so what did you do about it yesterday ?  I went sky-diving !  you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary !  It was scary , but it felt great , too .  weren't you scared ?  of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped .  so have you cured your fear of heights ?  I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly .  I'm impressed .  are you scared of anything ?  well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself .  what do you think is going to happen ?  I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things .  it sounds like you just need to be more careful . 
what sort of music do you like ?  I love just about anything by Prince .  so , you're into 80s music then ?  well , I like all kinds of music , but he is one of my favorites . How about you ?  I like alternative music .  do you have a favorite band ?  to be honest , no . I'm always in search of new music to listen to .  do you often go to concerts ?  I usually go to see a live band about twice a month . What about you ?  I love going to live gigs . Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend ?  there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . You should come along next week with me .  I'd love to , but I have a night class on Thursdays .  that's too bad . Maybe another time .  let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends . I have more free time then .  I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ?  sure , what's on ?  there's a reality TV show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .  that sounds dreadful ! 
do you need a hand ?  no , I can handle it . Thanks anyway .  are you sure you don't need any help ?  well , maybe just a little . I can't seem to make it fit .  I swear , the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller !  that's so true . thanks for your help . Are you in the aisle seat in this row ?  yes . What about you ?  I'm in the middle seat .  oh , I guess I'll let you through then .  thanks . sorry for making you get out of your seat again .  that's alright . I notice you have a few newspapers there . Would you mind lending me one ?  no , not at all . Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian ?  I prefer the British paper , but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away .  I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off , so the Guardian is all yours .  thanks a lot . That's really nice of you . Would you like a piece of gum ?  that would be great . thanks . 
Did you enjoy that new movie ?  That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon .  Oh , what happened , Carole ?  I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it .  What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming .  Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ?  Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ?  His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again .  I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me .  I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy .  Doesn't sound promising .  Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug .  If you want I'll let him know if I run into him .  Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get the class . 
excuse me ; is this seat taken ?  no . It's all yours .  thank you very much . My name is Ashlan . It's nice to meet you .  Carson . It's nice to mee you , too .  the weather is so warm for December , don't you think ?  it is unusually warm . I blame it on global warming .  global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere .  so sure . Are you from around here ?  no . I'm new here . I just moved here a few months ago .  where are you from ?  I'm from China . What about you ?  I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago .  did you enjoy it ?  I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ?  it's very different from Chinese food , but I am getting used to it .  Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there ?  yes , have you read it ?  no , but I saw the movie . What do you think about it ?  well , to be honest , I've only gotten though 10 pages of it . So far , though , it's interesting .  well , this is my stop . it was nice talking with you .  likewise . Bye !

I'd love to .  Ok , let's go .

Yeah , it costed a bundle alright .  Wow , this's sinking a hole .  Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned .  I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails .  We are on the high way . I'm the * * .  Wow , this car can really burn rubber .  It's a great feeling .  You made a perfect choice , Jack .  Thanks , Daisy . 
Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan .  Don't mention it , let's go in .  Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ?  She sure can .

Have you talk to him about it ?  Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night  Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .  This is no laughing matter , Nick .  Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?  He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .  Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ?
