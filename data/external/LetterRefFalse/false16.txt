What do you think about all the different diets that people go on ?  I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !  But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ?  They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .  So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ?  Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .  How about drinking soda ?  Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .  And have you ever tried taking vitamins ?  I used to take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start .  How do you know so much about food and dieting ?  You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size that I am now ! 
Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline .  Wow ! So many choices you have ! I wish I could , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight .  Come on , just a bite . It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite .  I'd better not . Please don't tempt me . Please !  Gee ! You are really strong-willed .  You're damn right . I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong .  Well , I'd better not tempt you . Otherwise , if I give you a piece of cake , you might ask for a glass of milk . 
Can you help me out , Chuck ?  Sure . What's it , Yvonne ?  I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move .  Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other . 
It's time to go . Are you ready ?  Almost . Let me get my bag . 
How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere .  What are you doing ?  I'm getting dressed , what does it look like ?  It looks like you are about to get dressed . Did you forget we are in a car on the road ?  I'm good at this . Nobody will see anything .  Are you kidding ? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking !  All right , pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies ' room .  That will be my pleasure . 
Mark , can you dress the twins for me while I take a shower ?  You don't know what you are asking !  Please ! You can do it . Their clothes are all laid out on the bed .  Remember what happened last time ?  Are you referring to KC getting her head stuck in the pant leg ?  Yes . That was a bit terrifying for both of us .  Don't worry ! Today they are wearing dresses !  Oh , in that case , sure ! Uh ... what are these long sock-looking things ?

You have a lovely house , Jack .  Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately .  That's too bad . What problems are you having .  Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .  I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ?  Go right ahead .  Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room  Wow , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions .  You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . 
Would you like a piece of birthday cake ?  No , thanks , I'll pass . It looks very tempting though .  I thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ?  It is . I'm on a diet and strawberry cream cheese cake is not on it .  A diet ? What for ? You are in great shape .  I went to the doctor the other day . My cholesterol is up .  Oooo . This sounds serious .

Mike , don't even think about it ! 
Oh , my god ! I look so old . I look as if I were 40 . I think it's time for some plastic surgeries . I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin .  I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You'd better stop being so ridiculous .  Anyway I think I need a nose job and some breast implants as well .  I think you need to get a brain surgery . Honestly speaking , you look charming .  I know what you mean . I just want to make myself more attractive .  You are fine the way you are . Besides , plastic surgery hurts .  Really ?  Sure it is . So you'd better get rid of this idea . 
I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines .  Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ?  It's natural . My friend told me you know how to work with curls .  That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck .  Do you have any product that controls frizz ?  With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that .  Thank you !  And when we're done , I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest . 
What can I do for you ?  I am looking for cologne , small bottle . Can I see that one in the glass shelf ?  Yes , of course , this one costs 260 yuan .  It's too expensive .

Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the lipstick ?  It costs only 25 yuan .  Oh , it's too expensive . Can't you make it any cheaper ?  The price is reasonable because the quality is super .

Thank you .

Did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ?  Yes , several times .  How do you like them ?  Not bad .  I always have the temptation to eat something there .  Then , why didn't you do that ?  I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?  Some of them , I think , are not good .  It doesn't taste good ?  No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .  That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?  I judge by appearances .  I got it . I think it's worth trying .  It certainly is .  I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .  Don't try everything at one time , please .  I see . Thank you .
