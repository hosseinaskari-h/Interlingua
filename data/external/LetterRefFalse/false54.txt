do you like playing games ?  I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games .  how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ?  the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned !  if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it .  how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ?  I didn't really have to figure it out . I just followed the instructions !  I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses !  hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube .  it's a deal .  do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ?  yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ?  I don't know . I haven't tried yo-yo since that party !  I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo .  if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it .  let's get started with this game then .  ok . 
how did your interview go ?  pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it .  if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ?  if I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer .  will you get a pay-raise , too ?  whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion .  that makes sense . Who interviewed you ?  my boss .  what kinds of questions did she ask you ?  she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be .  the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ?  I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally .  those are good answers . How did she react ?  she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team .  what do you think about her as a boss ?  she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .  you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss !  that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company .  when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know .  I will do . 
could we possibly discuss my salary some time ?  sure .  first of all , I want you to know that I really like working for this company . Do you think I'm doing a good job here ?  well , you are a very hard-worker .  I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent .  there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ?  I could really use a 5 % rise .  that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise .  listen , if you give me a raise , I'll take on extra responsibilities .  that sounds reasonable . How about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift , then you'll have to do it .  that's fine . Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work ?  of course . It's be against the law if we didn't .  that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it .  you are welcome . Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling . 
do you mind if I sit here ?  no , of course not . Go ahead .  don't I know you ?  yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school .  you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time !  What did you do after high school ?  I went straight to university afterwards . What about you ?  I took a year off to go travelling .  that sounds exciting . Where did you go ?  I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ?  I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department .  Oh , did you study a foreign language ?  yes , I got a grant to study Chinese .  that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ?  it is , but it's very rewarding .  so you can speak Chinese ?  I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die !  I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well . 
hello . Where are you headed today ?  I'm off to Barcelona for a week .  do you have your passport with you ?  yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ?  fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .  that's good advice .  would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?  are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?  let me see here ... yes , there's one left .  ok . I'll take that one then .  alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?  I like to travel light so I just have this one .  if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?  yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?  you're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight ! 
I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend .  oh .  don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days ?  sure .  I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do it get on the train tonight a  the train ? Will I be flying back then ?  oh , no . We've brought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable .  will the train be very crowded ?  oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine .  when is the first meeting then ?  they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning . That should give you enough time to have a quick shower .  where will I be staying ?  we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system .  that's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ?  that's not a problem . Have a nap if you can . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip . 
the May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ?  I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures .  where are you planning on going ?  I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ?  I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there .  would you recommend going there for a few days ?  personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .  you ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ?  it ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ?  I ’ d like to get away from the big city life .  maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing .  I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away .  since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number .  thanks ; I ’ ll give them a call later . 
Hey , Frank , there is that Janet Check .  Wow , what a great burd !  She sure knows how to strut her stuff .  She's a real turn-on our rights .  And look out she's dressed .  Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded .  No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants .  Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful .  I think you've lost it .  Well , that's my opinion .  I admit that she is much prettier than Kate .  Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly .  At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . 
welcome back ! How was your vacation ?  it was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring !  where did you end up going ?  because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there .  I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?  that was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?  sure . What's this one a picture of ?  oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .  you don't look very happy in that picture .  no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces !  so what did you do ?  we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .  my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ?  of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .  that's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . 
hi , how are you doing ?  everything's great . And you ?  same here . Have you seen any new films recently ?  no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce .  oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking .  yeah . I found it is so close to our life .  it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world .  you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years .  well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too .  I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married .  oh , that's too short-lived .  that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation .  I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage .  definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously .  in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone .  I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . 
Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?  I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .  Then let's go in .  I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .  I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .  I know . I wonder what's keeping him .  Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?  Yeah , a number of times .  What's he trying to pull anyway .  I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .  Maybe you should start seeing someone else .  You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy . 
more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners .  that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners .  oh , why ?  I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them .  I wouldn't say that's totally true . I've met many happy intercultural couples .  well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ?  I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men .  or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men .  what do you mean ?  you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl .  a left girl ? What's that ?  they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single ,  you have a point here , but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love .  that ' for sure but very few . 
if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ?  why ? Did tom pop the question ?  not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent .  let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ?  you are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place .  I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex .  oh , how did you deal with it ?  I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up .  oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ?  simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences .  like what ?  he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family .  Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first .  yes , he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working .  so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner .  not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . 
it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ?  what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ?  but we've done that many times . We want something fresh this time .  okay , let me think . What about a party-and-movie night ? We can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later .  sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive .  well , we can ask people to make small contributions .  I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB .  BYOB ? What's that ?  bring your own beverage . We can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks .  so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? I don't know how well that will go over .  maybe you have a point . How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . There'll be music but no band . Having the party in the office will make  oh , that sounds like fun ! 
hi , betty !  hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ?  pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great .  that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ?  well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don  that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work .  indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees .  that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that .  true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything .  well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good .  yeah it is . 
hi , Natasha , how's life ?  great . My family came to visit me .  oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ?  my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me .  I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me .  I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ?  yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children .  interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ?  the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da  do you get along well with each other ?  yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot .  you are very lucky to have such a nice family .  thank you . 
this party rocks !  you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here !  I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love !  well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ?  oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ?  yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me !  I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice .  I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league .  come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try .  okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game .  all right . But I think you ought to move soon .  why ?  I can see five other guys eying her up .  okay , here I go !  good luck ! 
do you have internet in your room ?  sure , I am a total internet junkie , I can't survive without internet .  really ? What do you usually do online ?  well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly I chat online . You could say I'm addicted to online chatting .  I never chatted online before . What's it like .  well , basically it's similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . You should try it at least once .  really ? Who do you chat with ?  to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals . See , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were  that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home .  well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace . You know internet won't do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . There are a lot of per  don't worry . 
ORG ! It must be so late where you are . What time is it ?  just after 2 am .  what's wrong ? Can't sleep ?  nope , actually I was waiting for you . I have something big to tell you .  really ? What is it ?  I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ?  I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ?  I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . If you have time I think we c  just give me the dates and I'll make sure I'm free . You know after all these chatting online , it will be great to meet you in real life . I look forward to seeing you soon !  me too . But I think I am going to bed now . my head is getting heavy . Have a nice day there !  thanks . This is so exciting . Sleep tight and sweet dreams !  talk to you later . 
hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ?  well , I spend a lot of time watching movies .  what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too .  oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ?  actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ?  art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .  really impressive . These two genres are totally different .  sure . I enjoy both of them very much .  how often do you go to the cinema ?  once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon .  movie salon ? where is that ?  it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there .  is it good ?  yes , you can find almost all new releases there .  really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership .  why not ?
