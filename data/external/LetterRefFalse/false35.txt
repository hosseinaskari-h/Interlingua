May I take your order now ?  Yes , please . What's special today ? Any special recommendations ?  Certainly . I would recommend ' Songshuguiyu ' .  The name sounds fascinating . What is it exactly ?  Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish .  Sorry , I'm not interested in vinegar .  Then , how about this one ?  OK . I'll have that .  Very good . Could I serve you anything else ?  Thank you . That's enough .  My pleasure . Just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . Please enjoy your lunch .  Thanks . 
Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 .  I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 .  So that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you .  Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ?  Yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us .  So now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and I need to pay £ 22.50 .  And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 .  And is that all ?  Yes , this is everything on the list .  So now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . Is that correct ?  Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ?  I think £ 5 would be good . 
Good evening .  Good evening . We've a reservation for a table for four . My name is Tim .  Let me check the list . Yes , we do have a reservation under Mr . Tim .  But there is a change in the number of people . There are seven of us . Three of my friends are coming soon .  It doesn't matter . Follow me , please . What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ?  Well , it's a window table that we've booked .  I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats .  Oh , I see . We'll have to make up with the center one .  Thank you for your understanding , Mr . Tim .  If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here .  Yes , I will . 
I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .  We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .  I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .  We need to find a good realtor .  Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .  What do you mean ?  Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .  But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .  Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .  I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems .  Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .  So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?  It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .  And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?  Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .  Why ?  That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .  Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .  It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .  I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .  All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore . 
Where to , madam ?  Grand Central Station , please . I want to catch a 6 p . m . train .  I think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam .  Here is the Grand Central Station .  Thank you . How much is the fare ?  The meter reads 9.15 dollars .  Here you are . Keep the change .  Thank you . 
Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant .  Thank you .  Do you have a reservation ?  Yes , I do .  May I have your name , please ?  Yes , it's Mr . Brown .  Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ?  Oh , this is just fine .  Please take a seat .  Thank you .  Here is the menu . 
Would you like to have a piece of cake ?  No , thank you . I'm on a diet .  Why ? You're not fat .  I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure .  Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident .  I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only .  Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties .  How much do they weigh ?  All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg .  But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest . 
Excuse me . Could you tell me the way to the Star Hotel ?  Yes . Go down the main road . You can't miss it .  How long will it take me to get there ?  It's only about a five-minute walk .  Thank you very much .  You're welcome . 
Where to , sir .  To this place , please .  Star Hotel . OK .  How long does it take to get to the hotel ?  About 20 minutes .  Here's the hotel .  How much is the fare ?  That's 10 dollars . 
Good morning , madam . I think I'm lost here . The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton .  Do you know in which area ?  No , I am sorry I have no idea . I am a stranger here .  I see . Well , do you know anything near the hotel ?  Oh , yes . My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station .  Then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the Central Railway Station .  Can you show me where the Central Railway Station is on this map ?  OK . 
Hello , are you interested in this Honda ?  Hi , I am just looking .  It's a good car .  What year is it ?  1999 .  How about the mileage ?  6,000 miles , all highway mileage .  What do you mean 7B  Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much .  Oh , why such a high mileage ?  The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line .  Okay . Does this car have a warranty ?  One month .  How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ?  You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage .  How much is it ?  $ 5,900 .  I'll have to think about it .  Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced .  Okay . 
What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ?  We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings .  I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap .  You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ?  Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so .  While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove .  We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green .  I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners .  Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook .  No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room .  Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year .  And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ?  Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ?  Four times might be enough . Not once or twice . 
Hi , Mike . I am going to move on the first of next month .  Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ?  Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ?  Not really .  What did you do for your last move ?  Since I did not have much staff , I asked my cousin to help me out .  Oh . that's very nice of him .  Yeah , it was . But I still have some information that I collected last time , and if you want , I will give it to you .  Yes , please . 
Miss , may I help you ?  Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different .  It's because of the view .  Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ?  Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms .  How many elevators are there ?  There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units .  How about the car-park space ?  There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents .  Any other facilities ?  Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only .  What is the completion date ?  The completion date will be July 1st 2007 .  How about the price and the bank mortgage ?  Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers .  How many payment methods are there ?  It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone .  Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help .  You're welcome . 
You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . For example , I like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal .  I totally agree . I really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and I don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . My last roommate was a drama queen . Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it .  Yeah , I really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . It's important that we don't get on each other's nerves .  That's right . We should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another . 
Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ?  I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there .  How often dose this bus go there ?  Every fifteen minutes .  I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ?  The No . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . You may take it .  Where can I find the bus ?  The bus stop is not far from here . Go straight on and you can easily find it .  Thanks a lot .  You are welcome . 
Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ? !  I'd like a coffee please .  Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee would you like ?  What have you got ?  Well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and Americano .  Goodness me ! So many choices ! I think I'll have a cappuccino please .  Here you are . You'll find the sugar just over there . 
Hi Steve , it's nice to meet you . I hear that you're looking for an apartment , and I just rented a two-bedroom downtown . I'm looking for a compatible roommate .  Great , I'm looking for a place right in that area . Your apartment sounds ideal .  Alright . So tell me , how would you describe yourself ?  I'm pretty social and outgoing , and I like making new friends . But I'm not a party animal , and I like to keep the apartment clean .  I'm like that too . I like to invite friends over sometimes , but I don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment . 
What is your favorite coffee ?  Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it .  All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?  Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .  I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .  Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world .  I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?  Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .  No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays .  I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now . 
Excuse me , is this where I can catch a bus to the museum ?  Yes , you're at the right stop .  Thank you .  Are you new here ?  Yes .  Have you got small change ? They require exact fare .  Yes , I've got some coins . How much is the fare ?  One yuan . When you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box .  I see . How often does this bus run at this time of day ?  It runs every ten minutes . Oh , here comes the bus .
