hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it .  is it a horror movie ?  yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ?  no way . I will be scared out of my wits .  that's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .  Hey , how could you like to taste my fist ?  alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ?  Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on .  that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies .  yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .  not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .  the Notebook is this type of movie .  really ? I haven't heard of it .  well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it .  Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go ! 
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ?  I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table .  you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China .  I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick .  you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you  a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood .  then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you .  I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . 
our company is going to do some cutbacks soon .  really ? Where did you hear that ?  I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ?  I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked .  no , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is .  that's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her .  Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere .  well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael .  no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t  well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost b 
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ?  it's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun .  well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ?  of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ...  don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself .  you're dancing so well .  you dance beautifully too .  when did you learn to dance ?  in college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ?  it's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz .  how about tango ?  oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ?  Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot .  thank you for the dance .  my pleasure . Let's go and have a drink .  ok . 
I really admire you , Diana .  why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue .  you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school .  I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect .  isn't there anything else ?  I have no idea .  you must have a high IQ score .  well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret .  go ahead .  my IQ score is slightly above average .  seriously ? But you are such a genius .  maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure .  well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ .  you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks .  oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ?  let's go ! 
hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door .  oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you .  nice to meet you too .  would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice .  thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ?  oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea and a tea set as well .  oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here .  you are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants  there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .  well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way .  that would be wonderful . Thanks ! 
what's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ?  to be honest , I wouldn't .  why ? Do you have to make a choice now ?  not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time .  what's the puzzle ?  my husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids .  oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way .  yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night .  oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren .  but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not .  definitely .  you know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness .  don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together .  I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child .  sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . 
have you ever thought about your ideal home ?  I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself .  what would it be like ?  well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me .  how many rooms would it have ?  I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected t  how many bedrooms would your dream home have ?  I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three .  how would you decorate your house ?  I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b  how many TVs would your dream home have ?  I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . 
what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips !  that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well .  all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific .  thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ?  no problem .  now let's have one together .  do you know how to set the timer ?  let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here .  OK , let's have a try .  cheese ...  did it come out ?  yes , but it's blurred and a little dark .  never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again .  Ok , let's go . 
finally we're on board !  yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats .  are they window seats or aisle seats ?  let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle seat .  ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed .  that's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out .  thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ?  I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat .  good idea .  don't forget to keep the seat belt on .  ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip .  yes !  and no hijackers .  oh , you have too wild of an imagination . 
is this seat taken ?  no . please sit down .  thanks .  are you also going to Beijing ?  yes , on a business trip . How about you ?  I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ?  yes , I went there once last summer .  really ? What did you think ?  I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway .  was it that crowded ?  yes . There were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans .  oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car .  that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation !  thank you very much ! 
Hello , Ms . Barkley . How are you ?  Fine , thank you , sir . It ’ s nice to see you again .  Good to see you again , too . How ’ s you family ?  Very well , thank you , Mr . Parker . 
Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while .  I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back .  Where were you ?  I was in New York for a wedding . 
Matthew ? Hi !  Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?  it's got to be almost a year now .  how have you been ?  I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .  yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?  not yet . I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .  well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?  Mrs . Thou ?  yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .  great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !  I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? 
what's your apartment like ?  it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus .  what is it like living in on-campus housing ?  it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it .  did you have to pay a deposit ?  no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month .  do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ?  no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here .  how long is your contract for ?  that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon .  have you started looking again yet ?  not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer .  Good luck ! 
you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ?  no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while .  but you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company .  we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work .  can't you hang out with them , too ?  I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out .  maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you .  I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her .  it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you .  you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore .  she's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend .  I've given her enough time . I'm over it now .  I still think you two should try to patch things up .  I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . 
what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?  my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .  three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !  well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive .  were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?  I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood .  did your husband's family get to meet your family ?  my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t  that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?  we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa .  you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?  not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! 
Mary , how was your date with john ?  it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common .  oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ?  he is tall and slim , fair-haired .  sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ?  he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .  oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ?  he didn't say , but he said he would call me .  maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much !  oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ?  come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry .  thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging .  that's what friends are for . 
you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander .  thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight .  how did you meet each other ?  she's a friend of Amy . We met at Amy's birthday party .  is this your first date ?  yes . I hope it pans out . Cross your fingers , Lily .  sure it will . Oh , no , it's seven fifteen already . I'm going to be late for my date .  oh ... so you buried the hatchet with Steven ?  absolutely not ! He's a cheater . I will never talk to him again . I'm over with him . He's history !  then who will you meet tonight ?  a guy I met on the internet three month ago .  really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ?  please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday .  I know , but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information . 
I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is .  hey , Isabelle ...  Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .  yes , I am the guy .  what a bummer ! You set me up ?  let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...  how dare you !  hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella !  why did you lie to me in the email ?  I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name .  I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .  I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .
