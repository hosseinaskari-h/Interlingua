Have you got change for a thousand ?  Let me see . 
Excuse me , I'm a little lost . Which bus do I take to get to Shi Da ?  Let's see . From here , you have to take the 278 bus .  Oh OK , where do I get off ?  You should get off at the first Shi Da stop .  Ok , thanks ...  You're new at this , huh ?  No , is it difficult ?  No , it's quite simple . When you get on , just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off .  How much does it cost ?  Only 15 NT per section . Oh look , that is your bus .  Wow , I can't thank you enough .  Don't mention it . 
What can I do for you ?  I would like to have a roll developed .  When do you need them , sir ?  How about tomorrow morning ?  No problem . Do you want 3 x 5 or 4 x 6 ?  The 4 x6 will be OK . Thanks .  And do you want the glossy or matted finish ?  I prefer glossy . How much ?  You pay when you pick them up . I don't need a deposit for just one roll of film .  Thanks ! 
Do you develop films here ?  Yes , we shall . What size do you like ?  Well , the 4 x 6 is fine .  Which do you prefer , color or black and white ?  The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .  OK .  I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?  They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?  Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .  No problem . Do you need another film ?  Yes , a roll of Kodak film please .  It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films . 
May I help you , madam ?  Yes , where's the meat counter ?  Follow me , please . Here it is . What do you want ?  I need to buy some pork for the party . Give me about one kilogram .  OK . Wait a second , please .  I wonder if the chops are fresh .  Yes , of course .  One kilogram , too .  Anything else ?  No , thanks . 
What can I do for you ?  I'd like to buy some milk powder . What would you recommend ?  We have many kinds of different purpose . I wonder whom you are buying for ?  My son . He is two years old .  I see , sir . This one is very good .  Is it ?  You may rest assured . It sells well .  May I have a look at the introduction ?  Certainly . Here it is . 
Hey , Ann . Wake up . It's time to get out of bed .  Oh , Dad . Do I have to get up right now ?  Yes , or you'll be late .  Why didn't my alarm go off today ?  It went off 30 minutes ago .  I must have slept right through it .  Rise and shine .  OK . I know . 
Ouch ! I just bit my tongue .  Oh , that hurts .  I think it's bleeding . 
Are you going grocery shopping today ?  I am , as a matter of fact . Do you have any special requests ?  Yes , please get some white bread , thick cut , some ham , not the processed stuff , some gouda cheese , some galla apples and . . .  Wait . This is sounding like a major list . Why don't you just come with me ? 
I want to get in shape . I feel like a fence sitter-not really fat , but not really healthy .  I know what you mean . I fit into my clothes , but I'm not always comfortable .  Would you like to get in shape together ?  What do you have in mind ?  How about going to the gym ? There's one really close to work .  I know the one you mean . Do you know how much the memberships are ?  As a matter of fact , they are having a promotion right now .  Let's go after work and take a tour of the facilities . 
Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved !  Did you think it wasn't real ? That's my pet lizard .  You have a pet lizard ? Somehow I never would have imagined that .  His name is Grunt . Come closer and I'll properly introduce you .  Does it bite or scratch ?  No , he's perfectly harmless . And he's not afraid of strangers either . Here , hold him .  Wow . He's heavy ! And his skin feels really cool .  Stick around and you'll get to know him better . He has a very unusual personality . 
Mom . I have to go school shopping . There's only one more week left .  Do you need money or what ?  I have this list of stuff that I need and I only have half the dough .  Half the dough huh . Well . How would you like to earn the other half ?  Do I have a choice ? Uh . That's a no . What can I do ?  I thought you'd never ask . The lawn needs to be mowed and the garage deserves to be cleaned . 
We can't go that way , the road is blocked for the next few days .  Oh , that's right . They're filming a movie up there , aren't they ?  Some high speed chase scene , I think .  I wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that .  I think that they get a pretty good payoff .  The movie company has to pay them ?  I don't know about all of that , but think about it , their business gets free publicity !  Oh , yeah , they get to be in a movie for the whole world to see ! 
May I help you , sir ?  Yes , I have many things to buy . I would like to choose the cleaning milk first .  All right . What is your type of skin ?  Dry . That's my problem .  You can use this . It has special effect for keeping your face moisturized . It has this lotion , as a gift attached .  Sounds good . What about shampoo ? I would like to buy the product that prevents scurf .  How about this one ? It is well-known for the effect of removing scurf .  Is it a newcomer ?  Yes , it is a new brand .  I do not care the brand as long as it works well .  Anything else ?  I want to buy the toothpaste , the brand of Jiajieshi .  Yes , here you are . 
Welcome . May I help you ?  Use , I want a eye-shadow .  We have different colours of eye-shadow . May I know what colour you usually wear ?  Purple . But today , I'm thinking of buying one in a bright colour .  Yes , I see . How do you like this one ?  May I have a try ?  Certainly .  It's still too dark . Any brighter colours ?  Not from this brand , I'm afraid .  What about other brands ?  How about this one ?  Oh , that's the very thing I need . 
Hey , Mom , look what I found !  Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house . 
Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ?  I did , Mom .  Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother . 
Can you tell me what's included in your warranty ?  Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years .  I see . What does that include ?  It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course .  What sort of response time do you guarantee ?  Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner .  Are there any exclusions ?  Not really . It's a very comprehensive warranty . I â€™ ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print . 
I'm so sorry about your brother , Mr . Wang .  Thanks , Jane .  If you need any help , just let me know . 
I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ?  What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp !  It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .  You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .  The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .  Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?  It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .  It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck .
