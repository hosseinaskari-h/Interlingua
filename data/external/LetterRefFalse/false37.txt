Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?  Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .  You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .  What's special about these things ?  Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .  Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .

Well , I'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet .  I want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too .  So do I . That's why I've been trying to lower my cholesterol level .  I've noticed you've been munching away on lots of fruits and vegetables recently .  That's right . I could stand to lose a few pounds , too .

Bob , look at this sentence . ' Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . ' It's interesting , isn't it ?  I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those ' strict nutrition philosophies ' about ?  I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories .  Probably , Rose . That must be the job of nutritionists .  Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable .  Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food .  Seriously ?  Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so .  Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet .  Absolutely right . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine .  But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for the nutrients to work out for the body .

People drink it with salt and lemon .  Right . It's very strong , just like alcohol . ( Frank sips Mao Tai . )  Yes , besides Mao Tai , we have Wu Liang Ye , Fen Jim and so on .
