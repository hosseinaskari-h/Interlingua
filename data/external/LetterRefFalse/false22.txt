I want to ask you for a favor . I want to rent an apartment here in Beijing , but as a foreigner , I don't know the normal practice . Can you give me some advice ?  First , why don't you tell me what you need , such as how big a room , where you want to live , whether you want to live downtown , and what you like to do . Then I can figure out which apartment is most suitable for you .  I am a student and want to live in Haitian , so that I can live close to my school . I like to play soccer and I like a quiet apartment so I can study .  I think that an apartment with two rooms and a kitchen would suit your needs . I can introduce you to a place for rent near your school . The apartment is on the 7th floor , so it is very quiet and suitable for studying .  That sounds great !  You can also go to the school's sports field to play soccer , and if you're lucky you might make some Chinese friends there . It is right near the market and has comfortable facilities .  Thank you so much . That's very kind of you . 
Good morning .  Good morning . May I help you ?  I want to place a long-distance call to London . Is this the right counter ?  Yes . Here's a booking form .

It's hard to say . It depends on how busy the lines are . Please take a seat over there . We'll try to put you through as soon as possible .  Thank you . 
May I help you ?  Yes . I'd like to send this parcel to Changchun .  How do you want to send it ?  I guess I'll send it by airmail .  Is there anything valuable ?  No , there are only some vases .  They are fragile articles . They must be packed in a proper strong box . Your light cardboard box won't do .  Have you got boxes for sale ?  Yes .  Is it all right this time ?  Yes . Now fill in two customs declarations and one despatch note in English . You'll have to take your parcel to the next window for examination when you have completed the forms .  OK .  Have you written down your return address ?  Yes , I have . 
Excuse me , is this the right counter for express mail ?  Yes , it is . What can I do for you ?  I want to send some important documents to Canada for my postgraduate admission .  Are they urgent , please ?  Yes , the deadline for applying is 1st Feb , so I hope they will arrive in 3 days .  Well , DHL is famous for its speed and reliability . It is the fastest international postal service available . The document will arrive in two or three days .  Really ? But can you guarantee the safety ?  Yes , I promise . Your document won't be broken or lost . All the items are handled by special staff and carried by a courier . It is reliable .  OK . I will send them now .  Please write the address and remittee on the express order and make sure there is no mistake on them .  All right . Here you are .  This is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . You can also check your post on our web . The post number is on the top of the receipt .  Thank you . I have got quite clear idea of it .
