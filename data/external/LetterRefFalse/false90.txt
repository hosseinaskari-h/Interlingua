I guess we should see Big Ben soon .  Yes . It is just round the corner . Oh , can you see the London Eye ? Look straight and to your right .  Look at this bridge . We will soon be crossing the Thames .  This is Lambeth Bridge . We will then loop back and cross the river again on Westminster Bridge .  Wonderful .

I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much .  I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting .  I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ?  The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m .  ( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb .  I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run , but the house has always been full .  What do you think of the leading actors ?  Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type .  You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough .

I'd suggest that you go to the Philately Store in Nanjing Road East , where the items are authentic and the prices are reasonable .  Good . Sorry to have troubled you so much , Miss .  You're always welcome . Anything else can I do for you , sir ?  No , thanks . I did not notice it has been dark outside . I think it is time to dinner .  I guess it is .

Let's go over this plan again .  From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .  And that is mostly flat , right ?  Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .  And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?  That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .  It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .  Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? 
I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ?  I'm very sorry , sir .

But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .  Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .  Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .  How many people are on the waiting list right now ?  Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
