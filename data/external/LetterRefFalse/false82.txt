There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ?  I haven't seen her yet .  I think that she is very pretty .  Tell me how she looks .  She's kind of short .  What height is she ?  She's probably about five feet .  That's nice , but tell me what she looks like .  The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes .  I think I might've bumped into her before .  Are you telling me that you've seen her before ?  I believe so . 
Did you go to school today ?  Of course . Did you ?  I didn't want to , so I didn't .  That's sad , but have you gone to the movies recently ?  That's a switch .  I'm serious , have you ?  No , I haven't . Why ?  I really want to go to the movies this weekend .  So go then .  I really don't want to go by myself .  Well anyway , do you plan on going to school tomorrow ?  No , I think I'm going to go to the movies . 
Did you make it to school today ?  I always do . Did you go to school today ?  No , I didn't .  You should have , but have you seen any movies lately ?  That was an odd change of subject .  Maybe it was , but answer the question .  No , not recently .  I want to go to see a movie this weekend .  What's stopping you then ?  I don't want to go alone .  So , will you be at school tomorrow ?  No , I want to go to the movies instead .

Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today .  Yeah , so are you planning on going ?  I think so . It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun .  It really does , I can't wait .  What time does the party start ?  It starts at 8 o'clock .  Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ?

Did you even bother to go to school today ?  Yeah , I went . Did you go ?  No , I didn't feel like it .  That's nice , have you been to the movies lately ?  No , but that was a random change of subject .  It may have been random , but have you ?  I haven't lately .  I would love to catch a movie this weekend .  So then , why don't you just go ?  I don't want to see a movie by myself .  Okay , so are you going to school tomorrow ?  I think I might just go to the movies . 
Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk !  Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ?  Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you .  Sure . Meet me at five . 
My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ?  Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago .  Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know .  Thanks , I appreciate that ! 
All right then , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll get those plans over to your office by Thursday afternoon .  Great . That will give me time to talk with my staff before I make final decision .  That ’ s what I was thinking . I ’ ll have them there by Thursday .  Good news . Thanks for getting things done so quickly . 
Thanks for the advice , Mr . Macmillan . I ’ ll keep it in mind . I had better head off though . I ’ m meeting my husband for dinner .  Sure , I ’ m heading out myself . Enjoy your evening .  Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads .  Thanks for the warning ! See you tomorrow ! 
Have you met the new manager in customer service ?  No , I haven ’ t gotten over there in a few weeks . How is he ?  She . She seems to be doing a pretty good job . Of course , anything would be better than that last guy !  You said it ! I can't believe he lasted as long as he did . 
how are you ?  I ’ m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here .  That ’ s for sure . You ’ re new , too , huh ?  Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ? 
You have an unusual accent , Mr . Robbins . Where are you from originally ? If you don ’ t mind me asking .  Not at all . I was born in Madrid , but I came to the States when I was a teenager .  I guess that must be what I ’ m hearing , I really couldn ’ t place it . Do go back to Madrid often ?  No , I haven ’ t been back for more than ten years . 
Would you like some more coffee ?  No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .  The waitress is bringing the bill right now .  This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?  Yes , this waitress did a great job .  OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 .  What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?  Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?  Yes , 20 % would be perfect .  Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 .  Yes , that was one fantastic meal !  I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week . 
Would you like to order anything else ?  No , I'm good . All we need now is our check .  The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak .  I have never had bad service at this restaurant , but this time was really exceptional .  Yes , she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience .  Let's take a look at our bill . The total price for our dinner is $ 36.00 .  How much money should we leave for a tip ?  I know that 15 % is a normal tip , but I really thought that this waitress went out of her way for us . What do you think about tipping her 20 % ?  She definitely deserves 20 % for a tip .  So we can add her tip of $ 7.20 to the bill of $ 36.00 and the total will be $ 43.20 .  Yes , what a wonderful meal !  It absolutely was a great meal . We'll have to return here for lunch sometime . 
Cindy . We were going to try to surprise you for your birthday . But you ’ re just too busy ! Can you tell me when you ’ ll be free ?  Oh , Brian . That ’ s really sweet of you guys . I would love to get together with all of you . How about Friday ?  Great ! What time ?  I ’ m free all afternoon . Why don ’ t we meet at 1 o ’ clock in the lobby ? 
Hi ! Susan ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages !  I ’ Ve been really busy . How is everything ?  Oh , fine . Hey , why don ’ t we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ?  Yeah , why not ? I ’ Ve got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? 
Martin .  Hi . John , it ’ s Emily . How ’ s everything ?  Great , thanks . What ’ s up ?  Oh , I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat . Have you had lunch yet ? 
Do you want some dessert ?  No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ?  Oh , here comes our waitress with our check .  The service here has been really great , don't you think ?  Yes , the service was quite good .  So , let's look at the check . The total is $ 36.00 .  How much do you think we should leave for a tip ?  Usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . I am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate .  I agree that 20 % would be just about right .  OK , so that will bring her tip to $ 7.20 . Add it to the $ 36.00 and the total is $ 43.20 .  Yes , what a nice dinner that was !  We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon .
