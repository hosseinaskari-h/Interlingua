Hi , Mikel . What's with you ? You look angry .  No , I just check my weight , I'm getting fatter .  True , you are getting a really pot belly , aren't you ?  I'll get you for that comments , George .  Just kidding , Mikel . Why don't you come work out with me ?  ah , I don't know a fit works . Last time , all I saw the gym were bunch of lidos , like me .  It works if you keep at it . Come on , let's go !  All right . But so help me it's a better work .  This feels great . I'm all reed up . I can keep going all night .  Not me . I'm too hot and I'm too tired .  Exercise has no benefit unless you sweat like a pig .  Well , that's not for me .  Thanks for coming , it was a real blessed .  It wasn't as good as you think .  You'll get used to it , Mikel , trust me . 
You look like a basket case .  I'm not surprised .  What's the problem ?  My brother in-law just dropped in from the states .  Yeah , and ?  I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake !  Why ?  He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile .  I guess you think twice next time he comes .  You can say that again .  So how long has he here for ?  Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming .  Well , I know you do the right thing . 
good morning !  good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ?  I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares !  that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday .  I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something .  what's that ?  well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic .  that's annoying , but nothing to worry about .  for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ?  just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset .  Ok , I'll try that .  is there anything else bothering you ?  just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do .  do you have any other plans this weekend ?  I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday .  try not to take on more than you can handle .  you're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks ! 
wow ! You're going to Tibet ?  yes , my brothe and I are going . We just finished making our itinerary .  that's really cool ! I've always dreamed of going somewhere like Tibet , seeing something unique .  great minds think alike . My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time . Do you have anything on your schedule ?  nothing particular .  why don't you join us ? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare .  oh , Tibet sounds great , but I'm afraid it'll cost too much . Last time I traveled to India , and it cost me a fortune .  come on ! We're traveling on our own . It won't cost too much .  ok , then count me in . where will we stay ?  the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap .  then make sure that you book me a room , too .  I'll take care of it .  and check whether they accept credit cards .  no problem . 
how come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ?  I've been having a hard time sleeping lately .  as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ?  well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful .  you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax .  you're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ?  taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress .  I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying !  you need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective .  you ’ re right . I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class .  besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply .  that ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night !  good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! 
what's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset .  to be honest , I was just dumped .  oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up .  no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling .  come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ?  I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .  well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ?  where is that ?  not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours .  what's there to see ?  there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes .  oh , sounds nice .  yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like .  ok . Then I can make up my mind . 
hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ?  I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .  oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?  we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec  wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !  tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?  perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .  no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .  we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .  great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .  no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .  Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us . 
What a nice day !  yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?  great , let's go !  hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .  exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...  yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !  why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .  are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?  never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?  yeah , I think so .  ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .  wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases . 
hey , Mary , what's up ?  not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .  oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ?  well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found his extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , a  it seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ?  there's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar h  well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you as me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty .  I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .  yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . 
We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ?  no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ?  what about a factory tour ?  you mean visit a factory ?  yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .  good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?  I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour .  really ? What do the companies do that for ?  I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known .  oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors .  exactly .  do we need an appointment beforehand ?  I'll call the tourist information centre to check . 
excuse me , is this the way to the Greta Wall ?  oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually .  I must have taken a wrong turn .  it doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it .  and then ?  take the next right . Drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall .  thanks a lot .  you ’ re welcome .  by the way , how long does it take ?  without traffic , it takes about an hour .  I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon . Do you think I can make it before closing ?  yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time .  great ! Thank you !  my pleasure , and have a good time ! 
it's a lovely day , isn't it ?  yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice .  is she American ?  yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams !  so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?  I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her .  sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ?  not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby .  that's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?  you bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight .  good luck !  thanks ! 
hey , Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ?  it was wonderful , but I was so tired .  did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ?  yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there .  what else did you see ?  art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say .  you must have had a great time .  yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening .  yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you .  on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems .  that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful .  you'll have to try for yourself some day . 
Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue .  is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ?  yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful .  I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ?  I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last .  yeah , that's nice .  hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home .  a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ?  I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border .  I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . 
who are you writing a letter to ?  I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ?  OK . I guess I could add something . Tell them that I send my love .  that's kind of boring . Don't you want to tell them anything else ?  well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion .  you've been promoted ? when did that happen ?  just today . I guess I forgot to mention it .  congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate !  shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ?  ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time !  it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off .  ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter .  I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June .  that's thoughtful of you .  and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us .  that's right ! I almost forgot about that .  what would you do without me ?  we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other ! 
Have you heard about the new iPhone ?  yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ?  I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one .  if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods .  how big is a shuffle iPod ?  the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first .  how many gigs of music can it hold ?  I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember .  how much do they cost ?  not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars .  you're right , that's not bad at all .  do you have an iPod ?  I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one .  why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ?  that's one of the problems with having an iPod . Though an iPod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your iPod . 
what are you looking for ?  I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer .  do you know what camcorder options are available ?  not really . I thought I'd just have a look today .  would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ?  sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first .  ok . This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . Why don't you see if you like the way it feel ?  it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ?  it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes .  can you also take still photos with this ?  yes , that is an option .  how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ?  yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark .  that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ?  It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera .  how does that compare with other models ?  there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one .  I guess you can't have everything , can you ? 
what's up ?  not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though .  what's wrong ?  I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline .  Are you using dial-up or broadband ?  actually , I've got a wireless connection .  In that case , you need to turn on your airport .  I hook up to the Internet every day . I can't believe I didn't do that .  do you like ever chat online ?  No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ?  Oh , no . You can register for free . Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it .  what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them ?  well , you can always block them . When I don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what I do .  what's your email address ? I'll add you to my contacts list .  it's aubreyinchina@yahoo.com .  cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help .  don't mention it . 
You wouldn't believe what I got in the mail today !  what's that ?  it's a letter from Ray and Sue in Shanghai !  have you read it yet ?  no , I thought I'd wait until you got home .  go on , read it out loud .  ok . It says , " Dear Jessica . It was so good to receive you letter . I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease ... "  when did you send her a letter ?  just a few weeks ago . Sue and I send letters to each other often .  I didn't know anyone did that any more . Ok , go on .  ok ... I'm going to have to skip over this section . It's girl-talk .  that's fine with me .  oh . It's actually all rather personal .  well , skip over all of that and read me the rest .  ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... " Ray and I look forward to seeing you in June . Write soon . With love , Sue . "  are we going to see them in June or are they coming to see us ?  didn't I tell you ? We're going to Shanghai to stay with them in June .  oh , I guess I missed that .  men ! 
Is that your phone ?  yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ?  it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ?  yes , it's got wireless Internet access .  that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ?  yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ?  no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go .  yes , I guess I should try to use it .  does it have a camera ?  of course it does . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ?  I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client .  sure . Here you go .  have you checked your voicemail recently ?  no , why ?  I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .  oh , yeah . Probably . I don't really know how to use this phone yet .  do you want to listen to your messages first ?  no , it's ok . Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later .  I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone .  I'm surprised you know so much about it . Where's your phone ?  it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet .  how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ?  it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time !  let's go shopping . You can't depend on public phones in this day and age !
