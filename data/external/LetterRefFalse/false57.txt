Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .  Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k  In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls .  yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout .  and he is English !

Keep surfing .  alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it .  oh , what is it ?  it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .  oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside .  yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch .  I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real .  cool .
