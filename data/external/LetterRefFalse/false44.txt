Welcome , sir , what can I do for you ?  I want to buy some records .  Whose record do you want ?  Are there the records of Michael Jackson ?  His records have been sold out . The new copies will be available next week .  Oh . it's too late . Maybe I should go to other video stores to have a look . 
What would you like to order , sir ?  I'd like to try some Chinese food .  We serve different styles of Chinese food here . But I'm not sure which one do you prefer .  I have no idea . Could you recommend some to me ?  Well . Cantonese food is rather light , Beijing food is heavy , and Sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .  Oh , I see . I'd like to have hot food .  If so , I suggest you have a taste for Sichuan food . Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot , but they have different tastes .  Really ? So do you have some specialties ?  Yes . Roasted Crispy Chicken and Spicy Beef are our specialties .  All right . I'll have them . 
Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough .  Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now .  I think you should be more careful next time .  Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that .

Do you take vitamin pills regularly ?  No , I don't , do you ?  Yes . Maybe you should do it too . You may not get enough vitamins from your food , you know .

What kind of breakfast do you want ?  Is there any difference ?  Yes , a continental one contains eggs , bacon , toast and juice . American one is the same as a continental one except the egg .  I think I would like the former one .

No , I learned by myself . I have a good cook book that I read when I have time . 
Tom , how do you think of second-hand goods ?  Why did you ask that ? Do you want to buy the used goods ?  I'm considering buying a second-hand computer for I'm short of money now .  You know the car I'm driving , which is still in good condition though it is second-hand . And it only cost me 300 dollars . It was so cheap .  But do you really mean that the second - hand goods are just as good as the new ones ?  It depends . So you must be careful buying second-hand goods . 
Is there anything I can do for you ?  Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner .  I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it .  That's all right .
