Mom , I don't feel well .  Are you sick ?  I feel dizzy .  Let me take your temperature .  Mom , I don't want to go to see a doctor .  Oh , honey , I think you've caught a cold , you should get a shot . 
What do you want to be ?  Dad , I haven't thought about it . I'm still young .  Oh , honey , but you must know what your hobby is , right ?  I like playing the piano .  Yes , you play the piano well . You could be a good pianist . That's good . 
Where are you off to ?  The movies . 
May I have the menu , please ?  Sure . Here you go . 
Peter , do you want to learn to play the piano ?  No , mom . Piano is for girls .  Well , there are many boys that can play the piano very well , like Jay Chou .  No way , mom . I don't like piano .  OK . But you have to promise me that you will study hard in your English class .  All right , all right . I understand . 
Jenny , Can you come and help me ?  Mom , what should I do ?  It's dusty everywhere in the house . Can you help me do the housecleaning ?  OK . I will call Peter to clean it together .  That's my good girl . The clothes need washing . I'll do the laundry . 
Mom , what are we going to make tonight ?  Curry and rice . What do you think ?  That sounds nice . I can peel the potatoes first .  Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot .  Mom , the water is boiling !  Honey , just turn down the stove . 
Can you make out what he's saying ?  No , it's too loud in here . 
It's your turn now , Helen .  OK . I'm coming .  This is your song . I picked it for you .  Thank you . You are so considerate .  Push the red button on the mike to turn it on .  OK . This key is too high for me .  I think it's a piece of cake for you .  OK . Let me have a try ...  Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day .  Thank you . I'm sure you will .  I hope so . Thank you for saying so .

Can you pass me the lighter ?  Here . Catch ! 
Have you ever sung with a karaoke ?  Yes , I do it quite often .  Karaoke has become a major entertainment . I wonder why .  Simple , it's fun .  How much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ?  Ah , that's the biggest fun of all . You see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you .  I wouldn't do that .  But I like the feeling . 
What kind of music do you like ?  I like popular music best .  Me too .  Who is your favorite singer ?  Qi In is .  Do you know this song ?  Yes , I like it very much .  Let's sing it together , shall we ?  No problem .
