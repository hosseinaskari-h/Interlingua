The kitchen stinks .  I'll throw out the garbage . 
So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ?  Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff .  Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette .  What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for .  Not for me , Dick . 
Are things still going badly with your houseguest ?  Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw .  Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law .  You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed . 
Would you mind waiting a while ?  Well , how long will it be ?  I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can .  OK . We'll wait . 
Are you going to the annual party ? I can give you a ride if you need one .  Thanks a lot . That's the favor I was going to ask you for .  The pleasure is mine . 
Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ?  I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this .  What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? !  Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick .  Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain .  I am wiped out . Thank you .  Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ?  Never ! But thank you for inviting me .  Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . 
Can I take your order now or do you still want to look at the menu ?  Well , I want a fillet steak , medium , but my little girl doesn't care for steak . Could she have something else instead ?  Certainly . How about spaghetti with clams and shrimps .  Sounds delicious . OK . She'll try that . 
Can you manage chopsticks ?  Why not ? See .  Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ?  Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG .  What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food .  According to some studies it may cause cancer .  Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population .  I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .  I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons . 
I'm exhausted .  Okay , let's go home . 
Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ?  No , we don't .  How many of you , please ?  Six , including two kids .  I'm afraid all the big tables are taken . 
What kind of food do you like ?  I like Chinese food .  But your American ?  We have a lot of Chinese restaurants in America . 
Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ?  Yes . Thank you .  Would you care for a drink before you order ?  A glass of Qingdao beer .  Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ?  Will you make some recommendation ? 
Can I help you sir , what do you need ?  I need a packet of cigarettes please .  Of course sir , no problem .  Thanks . 
Could I have my bill , please ?  Certainly , sir .  I'm afraid there's been a mistake .  I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ?  I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6.5 dollar appears here , then again here .  I'll just go and check it for you , sir . 
May I sit here ?  By all means . 
Is everything to your satisfaction ?  No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .  Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day .  So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it .  I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .  No , thank you . 
I'm looking for a white purse as a gift . Could you show what you have in stock ?  You are in luck . We just receive a shipment of several different styles of white purses .  They must be popular again this season .  Yes , I believe they are . Here are something that might interest you .  Wow . this is nice . I'll take this one . I guess if she doesn't like it she can return it , right ?  Sure . Let me ring this up for you at the register . If you would like , this can be gift-wrapped for free . Just take it to the customer service department . 
Dahua's Market . How can I help you ?  Where is your store located ?  We are on Nanjing Road , next to the theatre .  Right , I'll be right over . 
Farmer's Pet Store .  Can you please tell me where you are located ?  Sure , we are off Singing Road , close to the bank .  Thank you , I know where that is . 
May I help you find something , sir ?  I'm looking for an engagement ring for my girlfriend . I have an idea of what she likes , but I want to surprise her with something special , too .  We have all shapes , sizes , qualities and price ranges , do you know about the four Cs of picking a diamond ?  I think so . Aren't the four Cs , cut , clarity , carat and color .  You've got it . Tell me a little bit about what you might be wanted .  Well , my price range is a 5,000 dollars to 7,000 dollars , I'm looking for a marquise cut on the wide band .  You have good taste . Let my show you what I have .
