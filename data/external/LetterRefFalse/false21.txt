I'm sorry to interrupt you . Please take care not to make a mess while you are selecting goods . If you don't want it , please replace it .  Oh , I'm terribly sorry . but I couldn't find the yoghurt I saw here last time .  What's the brand ?  San Yuan .  Oh , it's out of stock at the moment . Why don't you choose another brand instead ?  I'm not used to other brands .  You can have a try . Maybe you will like it .  OK . I hope so . 
Good afternoon , sir . Gan I help you ?  Good afternoon , I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired .  Which brand are you interested in ?  I'm still not sure . The type with top quality , I guess . Well , which one do you recommend ?  Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ?  It doesn't matter much . If it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be OK .  How about Flymo ? It's selling well .  Do you have a warranty on it ?  Of course . The warranty period is one year .  If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ?  Sure . But you must show us the receipt . If something comes up , we'll change it for you .  OK . I'll take one . 
Lucy , where are you going ?  I want to go to the supermarket .  Wait a few minutes and I'll go there with you .  Let's get a shopping cart .  Good idea  What are you going to buy ?  Let's check out the fruit section first .  OK . I'd like some oranges . But they don't look quite ripe yet .  Look , nice fresh cherries ! They are ripe and soft . I'll take some .  I'll take some , too .  Let's go to the snacks section . I want some chocolate and sweets .  OK . I'll go and buy some cakes .  Do you want to buy something else ?  No . Let's go over to the check-out stand . 
Mom , I finished .  OK . Could you please help me to clean them ?  Of course .  Great . At first , you can put the chairs back .  OK . Now I'll put the dishes in the sink .  Thank you . I'll wash them .  OK . Then I will clean the table .  Good boy . 
I had a busy morning .  What did you do ?  I watered all the plants .  You have a lot of plants .  Then I did my laundry .  That takes some time .  I took the dog for a walk .  I'll bet he enjoyed his walk .  I vacuumed the entire house .  That's a lot of work .  And then I made lunch .  I'll bet you were hungry ! 
My mom and dad insist that I be home before ten . Do you have a curfew ?  Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember .  I wish my parents were a little more lenient .  I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time .  You like going to bed early ?  I don't like being too tired the next day .  Well , I still hate having a curfew .  If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway . 
I found a great school for Junior !  Don't you think it's a little early to be looking for schools ? We haven't even had the baby yet !  We can't be too cautious about these things .  You are going to be such an adorable father ! Tell me about this school .  There is a huge slide on the playground and lots of trees and even a little brook !  What about inside the school ?  There is a library right inside the front door .  I think our child is going to love it ! 
What do you think about half day kindergarten for Stacey ?  We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it .  I just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat .  You have a good point . She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours .  I think she is really going to like her teacher though .  Yes , they seemed to click at the meeting the other day .  Did you happen to notice if she was interested in any of the other kids ?  No , but I did notice that she was very interested in the art supplies !

Mom , will you tuck me in tonight ?  Sure , honey . I'll read you a bed time story , too .  I hope I don't have any nightmares tonight .  Don't worry , you'll sleep well tonight .  Thanks for tucking me , Mom . 
Peter , it's time to get up .  Ten more minutes , mom .  What time is it now ?  It's already 3 8 o'clock .  Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school . 
Peter , take off your pajamas .  What should I wear today ?  It's chilly outside , so don't forget to put on your jacket .  How's the shirt ?  Son , it looks great on you .

Oh , this one is perfect . 
Is Bob home ?  Hold on 
Hello !  Hello , Is that Stefan ?  I'm sorry , but I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number.There is no Stefan here .  Really ? Are you sure ? I called before and he was there .  Yes . I'm sure .

It seems that you have misdialed .  Oh , I'm sorry I bothered you . I'm really sorry .  It doesn't matter . It happens to everyone .  Sorry again for bothering you .  That's all right .
