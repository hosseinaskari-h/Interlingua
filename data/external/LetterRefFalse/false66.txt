what are you doing ?  I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .  you really like brains that make you think , don't you ?  I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ?  I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at !  doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ?  well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours .  did you play a lot of games when you were little ?  my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend .  do you still like playing those games ?  not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ?  everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games .  some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ?  no , I prefer to play with people I know .  how about mah-jong ?  it's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it .  I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong !  I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! 
so , which sport do you prefer---basketball or baseball ?  to be honest , I don't really care for either one .  I thought everyone liked basketball . Why don't you like it ?  I used to play basketball when I was little , and I never scored a goal . Every time I watch a basketball game , I think about how horrible I was at it .  that makes sense .  how about you ? What's your favorite sport of all time ?  my absolute favorite is ice hockey .  have you ever seen a live game ?  sure , many times . It's an exciting game for spectators to watch .  I've never really understood the game .  it's not that difficult . If you want to watch a game with me , I can explain the rules and the tactics while we're watching .  thanks , that'd be nice . When's the next ice hockey game on ?  not for a while , but we could watch an old one on the internet so I can explain the game to you .  that's a good idea .  let's watch the Canadian team . They have a good manager and a great coach . 
what did you do last night ?  I just stayed at home and watched TV .  did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ?  yes , it was a very evenly matched game .  what were the results of the game ?  it ended in a tie .  what was the actual score ?  it was three all .  really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .  if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .  what happened ?  their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway .  that explains it .  how many more games are left this season ?  that was the last game before the playoffs .  when do the playoffs start ?  in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ?  of course ! I really love watching football games on TV .  Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together .  sure , that would be great .  Ok , it's a date then ! 
Congratulations on the new house !  Thanks ! We love it .  Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful .  I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it !
