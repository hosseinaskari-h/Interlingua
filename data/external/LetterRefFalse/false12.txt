Watch out , Jenny ! Be careful of the cars .  I'm fine , dad .  Did you get hit ?  No , dad . Can I go there to play ball ?  Watch out for strangers , and don't go too far away . Alright ? 
Do you shop online often ?  Every so often . It is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores .  Are there many things online ?  Books , cosmetics , daily necessities , even large electrical appliance can be ordered from online-stores .  Incredible . I really want to survey the on-line virtual supermarket .  Even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' But It Now ' prices .  What are the disadvantages of on-line shopping ?  Some provide wrong pictures for the goods , so many buyers are deceived . 
Peter , it's time to go home now ! Hurry up !  Ten more minutes , mom . Please !  Honey , it's almost noon . We have to go home and make lunch for your sister .  I bet she will hang around with her mates after school .  Peter , it's a quarter to twelve . Let's go home now ! 
Don't tell me you're pregnant again .  I'm afraid so . 
I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ?  Indeed . Online banking enables you to make on-line shopping .  Do you know how to get the bank account ?  Bring your ID card and fill out a form . That will be fine .  So easy .  I think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than ATM processing speed .  My shopping life will be more convenient . 
Honey , I need to have a talk with you .  Dad , I have to do my homework .  No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ?  Dad , I don't want to talk about it now .  Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why .  I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school . 
Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ?  Absolutely we need a house here . But what makes me upset is the prices in this city .  Our monthly salary can not buy one square meter of the house here .  It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher .  More and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry .  And the rich still wants to buy more , even though they have at least one house to live .  Have you watched the TV series , Humble Abode ?  Yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars .  I really , really want a house , even though it is small like a snail house . 
Stop burping .  I can't help it . 
Can you give me a hand ?  Of course . 
Let's go now .  I'll be with you in a minute . 
Kate , can we change the channel ?  Why ?  This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs .  OK . You can change it .  What about this one ? Do you like this program ?  No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ?  Yes . Oh , it's a talk show .  Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ?  No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it .  I'm sure you will like it . 
Mom , can I watch TV ?  No more today , honey .  Alright , Mom . Should I turn off the TV right now ?  Yes , honey . Go to your room , and take out your book . It's your reading time now .  Mom , where is the remote ? I can't find it .  Just go to read . I will find it , honey . 
OK , Tom . It's your turn . Are you ready ?  I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?  Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song !  I know , but ... Hey , Jim's here ! I've been waiting to hear him sing all night .  Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him ? He loves ' The King ' .  I'll put the song at the front of the list . 
Can you give me a hand with my luggage ?  Of course . 
Peter , have you seen my purse ?  No , mom . I haven't seen it .  That's strange . It should be on the desk .  Mom , did you try the basket on your bicycle ?  Not yet . Let me see . 
Hello , I'm sorry for calling this late . May I speak to Peter ?  I'm sorry . He's not in right now .  When is he coming back ?  He should be back in ten minutes . Could 1 you call back later ?  I'll call again in thirty minutes . 
I received an E-mail from mother today .  What did she say ?  She missed us and asked when we would go back home .  What's your plan ?  I don't know . Maybe next week . We haven't been to the Great Wall yet .  Right , then you'd better send an E-mail to tell her .  All right . 
These vegetables taste very sweet .  Sure , I planted them . They're organic .  Really ? Dad , how do you know how to plant organic vegetable ?  Well , it's a secret .  Dad , come on ! Just tell me .  Well , honey , I can teach you how to plant them if you want to learn . 
Do you know anything about health food ?  It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food .  Can you give me some examples ?  Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy .  Really ? Why we must have warm and fresh water ?  Warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system .  Anything else ?  Yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . If you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable . 
Our dinner is ready .  What do we have for the dinner now ?  Potatoes , tomatoes and cucumber .  Do you feed rabbits ?  It is said that greens can improve our metabolism . In addition , I want to keep fit .  Where is my favorite white bread ? Is it in refrigerator ?  I didn't buy any of it at all . Most health food are good for you , but don't taste good .  Do you prepare some dessert for me ?  I am clear about your sweet tooth , so I made a mixed fruit dish for you .  Are you trying to change our eating patterns ?
