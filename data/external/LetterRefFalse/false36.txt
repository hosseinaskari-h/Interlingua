May I know where you are going ?  Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel .  I'm sorry . You are going in the wrong direction .  Oh no ! What shall I do ?  Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . The bus stop is right there .  Thank you very much .  My pleasure . 
Here we are on the train .  Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon .  I hear many people have cars .  Yes , almost all the families have their own cars .  Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ?  Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown .  I see . 
Good coming , sir .  Good morning .  Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ?  Of course not . But I don't know when to get off .  Where are you going ?  I'm going to Wangfujing .  Don't worry . I'll let you know when we get there .  Thank you very much . 
How much is the fare ?  Three yuan .  Could you tell me how to use it ?  You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform .  Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ?  That's very easy . The exit is always open .  Thank you for your help .  My pleasure . 
May I try on this pair of shoes ?  Of course . What is your size ?  I think it's 35 .  OK . I'll get it for you .  Hmm , I don't feel very comfortable .  Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ?  This is just right for me . I'll take this one . 
Can I see some men's watches ?  Of course . How about this one ?  What functions does this watch have ?  It's a luminous watch with a time-reminder function .  Is it waterproof ?  Yes , and it comes with a worldwide guarantee .  I'll take it . Please set the watch for me . 
Let's go to the cinema by bus .  Better take the subway . It's far quicker and more convenient .  OK , it will be a new experience for me .  We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .  Where do we pay the fare ?  Just give the man sitting there three yuan and he'll give you a ticket .  Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?  No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically . 
May I help you , sir ?  I'd like to buy a shirt .  What color do you want ?  I prefer the blue one .  What size are you ?  I'm not sure . Could you measure me , please ?  No problem . I think 40 will be fine for you .  Can I try it on ?  Of course . The fitting room is this way , please . 
Would you please show me the necklace in the window ?  Is this the one you want ?  No , the one next to it .  Here you are .  Thanks . What kind of stone is this ?  It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ?  Yes , please . How much is it ?  It costs $ 200 .  It looks good . OK . I'll take it . 
Let's have a look at the map first .  All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .  Let's buy some tickets .  The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train  Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?  No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them . 
What would you have ?  I'll try Chinese wine .  What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .  OK . Give me one , please .  Here it is .  Thank you .  I'm always at your service . 
May I recommend you Tsingtao beer ?  Tsingtao beer ?  Yes , sir . It's one of the best beers in China .  Really ?  Yes . The beer is brewed by using carefully selected malts , rice , hops and natural water from the Lao Mountain .  How about its taste ?  Fine , sir .  That sounds great . Two Tsingtao beers , please .  Tin or bottle ?  Tin , please .  Would you like it on the rocks , sir ?  No , thank you .  You're welcome . 
Welcome !  Would you give me a bottle of beer , please ?  With ice , sir ?  No , ice will spoil the taste .  Anything else , sir ?  Yes . Something non-alcoholic , please .  Fruit juice , milk or mineral water ?  A glass of juice please .  Coming up immediately . 
I'd like to reserve a table for two , please .  For what time , sir ?  Around 8: 30 p . m .  May I have your name please , sir ?  Yes , Anthony Fox .  Mr . Fox , we'll hold the table for you for ten minutes . Please be sure to arrive before 8: 40 . 
Are you ready to order now , sir ?  Yes , I'll have a steak , please .  How would you like the steak , rare , medium , or well-done ?  Rare , please .  Would you like something to drink ?  Coffee , please . 
Two number 3s , please .  All right . What would you like to drink ?  Diet Coke .  Regular or large ?  Regular , please .  OK . Anything else ?  No , thanks .  For here or to go ?  For here . 
Waitress , can I have the bill , please ?  Yes , sir . How would you like to pay the bill , sir ?  Do you accept credit cards ?  Yes , sir . But we only accept American Express , Master card and Visa . What kind do you have ?  Master card . Here you go .  Wait a moment , please . 
Good afternoon , sir . Can I help you ?  I'd like a beef-burger , a French fries and a milk shake , please .  What flavor would you prefer , sir ?  I'm not quite sure . What do you have ?  We have strawberry , chocolate , vanilla and banana .  Very well , I'll try the banana flavor .  Anything else , sir ?  No , thanks . That will be all . 
I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs .  Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord .  What does it come with standard ?  On all our new cars , the standards include  Cruise control ? I don't like that .  Why not , sir ?  I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ?  Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident .  I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either .  You know , sir , you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on .  I suppose . And What about the sunroof ? Is that standard ?  No , the sunroof is optional , sir .  I see . 
For me , now an important question to buy an Accord is the time when I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon .  Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now , we will have it for you in August .  That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ?  We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .  My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .  I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ?  Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ?  Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available .  Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car .  You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable .  Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk .  Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment .
