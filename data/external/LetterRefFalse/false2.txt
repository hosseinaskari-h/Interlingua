Would you like a lift home ?  That would be great . Thanks ! 
Mike's Mechanics . Can I help you ?  Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ?  Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum .  Thank you very much . 
I think I going to need some iced water too . Is there an extra charge for that ?  Yes , we charge 50 cents for water .  That's fine . Could you give me some more napkins , too ?  Sure . Do you need anything else ?  Yes , I would also like some sweet and sour sauce and pepper .  I'll put all that into the bag for you .  Do I owe you anything for the sauce , pepper and napkins ?  No , there is no charge for those . 
I'm looking for some blush . Do you still have some in peach rose ?  Oh , yes , that is a beautiful color . It has been very popular blush this season . I have two left .  Great , I'll take one .  Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 18 dollar 50 cents in any Elizabeth Arden products , you will receive this black poke with a sample of lipstick , mascara and two shades of white shadow .  Wow , that sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and toner . Could you ring those up for me too along with the blush ?  I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else ?  Oh , I almost forgot . It's my mum's birthday Saturday . I need to get her some more Chanel . Could you get me the 1.7 ounce bottle of Chanel cologne ?  That would be my pleasure . I'll wrap the perfume up in the gift box for you too . 
Golden Taxi cabs , how may I help you ?  Can you send a cab to pick me up ?  Sure , where are you ?  I'm on the corner of the Fifth and Mane . 
OK , I'm sorry it took so long .  I understand .  The phone has been ringing off the hook today .  Some days are just like that .

I'm looking for some black pumps to go with my evening gown . Could you show me what you have ?  Sure , we have several different styles you may choose . How high of a heel do you want ?  Not to high , maybe an inch or an inch in the half would be the best .  In that case , I might have just the pair for you . Look at these , they were made in Italy , the leather is very soft , so your toes will not get pinched . You can tell just by looking at it that it was superbly made .  Those are beautiful . Do you have any in a size six ?  Yes , we do , we also have this same style in dark blue and red .  No , thank you . I'm just looking for a black pair .  Let me go to the back and get them . I'll be right back . 
Are you OK ?  I'm fine . I'm just so touched by the sad story .  So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . Which scene is your favorite ?  I love them all . But if I had to name one as the best , I would say it's the ending .  What's it about ? You know , I couldn't help falling asleep .  Did you ? I didn't notice that . But still you should know it , for you have seen it with Laura before .  I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her , too . I mean falling asleep . For me , this one is not that attractive .  Then I doubt if you like operas at all .  Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one .  OK , then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave , with a rose in his hand . When he got there , he saw someone already put a rose on her grave .  Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice .  Me , too . There was always a good round of applause every time she sings .  Yes , the applause ! That was what kept waking me up during the show .  And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting , and music . Just amazing !  No doubt , it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' .  Exactly . 
Did anyone call ?  Just Mr . White .  What did he want ?  He wouldn't say over the phone . 
Could I have the check , please ?  Okay . I'll just be a minute . 
Any phone calls for me while I was out ?  Yes , your wife and your dentist called .  Thank you .  You're welcome !
