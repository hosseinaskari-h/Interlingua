hey , Lily , what are you doing ?  waiting for someone .  you mean the boy you met on MSN ?  you're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him .  you must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met !  I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online .  I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious .  well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him .  did you tell him ?  yes . He said I'm his dream girl .  you shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie .  I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice .  I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . 
what do you think about all the different diets people go on ?  I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !  but what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ?  they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .  so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?  sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small desert .  how about drinking soda ?  many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try  that's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ?  my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start .  how do you know so much about food and dieting ?  you might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! 
I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose .  do you have any other symptoms ?  I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ?  just a little . Has your toothache gone now ?  yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway .  how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ?  no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed .  how did you get that burn again ?  I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago .  you haven't had much luck lately , have you ?  no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon .  when's the last time you took your tablets ?  I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch .  I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ?  just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much .  sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ?  that sounds good .  soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . 
you don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work .  I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .  do you feel ok ?  not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .  why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .  could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?  you're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .  ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .  Zach , what's that on your arm ?  I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .  it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?  just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .  I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . Let's go .  shouldn't we make an appointment first ?  we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .  whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! 
do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?  sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ?  I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .  that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?  I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy .  if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ?  I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .  you're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .  the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .  the Taj it is then .  shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?  they'll still charge us a corkage fee .  that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .  don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight .  are you sure ? We could go Dutch .  no , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time .  I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! 
hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor .  that depends . What is it ?  it's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loans  I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings .  if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise .  let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now .  thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place .  that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ?  how about at 6 pm ?  see you then ! 
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ?  of course . Is the dinner still on ?  yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .  we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .  that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark .  it can't be that bad .  I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .  really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime .  do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better .  ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ?  when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation .  has anything else happened to you ?  nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .  well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . 
does your family have a record of your ancestors ?  sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ’ s always updating it .  do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ’ d love to see it .  I can show it to you now , if you like . I think it goes back about 8 generations so far .  that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ?  I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side .  are you very close to your first-cousins ?  the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones .  I see . who ’ s the head of your household ?  it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family .  that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ?  at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother .  that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . 
Hey , Teresa , meet the new neighbors yet ?  Actually , i popped in them last night .  OK , let's cut to the chase . what are they like ?  Well , they're really beautiful people .  I'll say , she is really stacked , isn't she ?  Yeah , she is a neck-off for sure .  And he looks like a typical jog .  He is a professional football player .  Ah-ha , I thought so .  Anyway , that is not what I meant by beautiful .  What did you mean ?  I meant that they're very simple , easy to talk to .  That's right .  Yeah . I think things are worked out just fine . 
have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ?  no . what's it like ?  it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through  would you want to live there ?  I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro  what's your dreamhole like then ?  my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England .  would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ?  old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important .  it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ?  no , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time !  I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ?  no , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a 
Hey , Vernassa . why be angry look ?  It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts .  I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ?  She made another white crack about my clothes .  Are you sure she was trying to put you down ?  Of course , I am sure .  You shall go easy on her . she is new here .  Just how am I supposed to do that ?  You shall just take it in surprise .  I've tried , but she keeps pushing my buttons .  Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ?  I am not . she is no picnic .  Well . if you think I can help , let me know .  Thanks , Serena . 
How many people are there in your family ?  There are 15 people in my family .  What did you say ? How many ?  15 people .  Wow . That is a very big family . Do you all live together ?  Of course we do ! My father's parents , Mum , Dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me .  But you don't live at home anymore .  Right , but that's where my heart is . But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home .  My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house .  Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis  Wow ! you grew up in a school ! No wonder your English is excellent !  My aunts and uncles are all teachers .  You are so lucky !  I guess so . While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year .  That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time .  I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English .  800 books ? I'm impressed !  My aunts studied in the American universities.They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English.That ' s what they learn here in America . 
hey , the new SOHO . How's everything going ?  everything's great . I've just returned from my office .  your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ?  sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area .  a virtual office ?  yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building .  what kind of services do they offer ?  a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office .  sounds fun.what else ?  I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor .  oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image .  you bet it ! 
How could you handle living in such a big family ? Does everyone get along ?  Sure . We love each other and take care of each other .  In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ?  My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions .  Is a family like yours common in South Korea ?  No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho  My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting  Of course there'll be a room for you !  To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids .  Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys .  But four boys !  It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes .  You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want .  It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ?  That's a great idea !  We could share a room ! It would be fun . And we could do some traveling around Korea . You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like !  That sounds like an excellent offer . I might take you up on that . Thank you for the wonderful invitation . 
Can you play baseball with me today ?  No , I can't . I'm sorry . I have to help my mother . We're going to move tomorrow .  Where's the new house ? Is it far from here ?  No , it's not far . It's near our old house .  Can I help you pack ?  Sure . Thanks . 
I haven't danced for a long time .  Neither have I .  We must go to a dance soon , or we'll forget how to dance .  Yes , we must . What have you been doing since I last saw you ?  I've been studying hard for my examinations . And you ?  I've been learning Japanese every evening .  Why have you been learning Japanese ? Why not English ?  I hope to visit Japan next year .  Well , we'll both have to start learning all the new dances .  Yes , let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons .  A good idea . They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us ! 
Did you watch television last night , Charles ?  Yes , I did .  It was a good game , wasn't it ?  Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film .  What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well .  How did it finish ?  It finished in a draw . What was the film like ?  It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first .  Did your wife enjoy it ?  No , she didn't . After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book . 
I hate to say goodbye , but it's late .  Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 .  I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go .  OK.See you on Today .  See you on Moday.Have a great weekend .  You too.Thanks for dropping in . 
Good morning , Sue .  Good morning , Tom.How are you ?  I'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ?  Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ?  I am heading for the library . I've got a research project to do.How about you ?  I'm going to the English class.It ' ll start in five minutes , I've got to run .  See you later , alligator .  After a while , crocodile . 
Hi , John ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages .  Hi ! Yes , it ’ s been a long time . I ’ m really glad to see you .  I ’ m glad to see you , too . How ’ Ve you been ?  Just fine . How is everything with you ?  Not bad . I finally bought a house . It ’ s an old one , but built really solid . It is close to here . Do you want to come over for lunch ?  I ’ d like that , but I ’ m flying home this afternoon , and I told my parents I ’ d meet them at the airport for lunch .  OK , next time you ’ re here .  That ’ s a deal .  I heard that you moved to Florida .  Yes , I ’ m in Titusville . The space shuttle is launched from near there . I ’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches .  Tell me more .  The shuttle launches are beautiful . I saw one that took off at midnight . The whole sky got bright .  Sounds great !  I ’ m pretty happy living there .  I want to see Disney World , Sea World , Universal Studios , and Weeki-Watchee Springs .  I ’ Ve been to all of them .  I ’ m jealous . I ’ Ve never been to Florida .  The Sunshine State certainly is worth visiting . Come down for a vacation sometime . I ’ ll take you to Disney World .  That sounds great ! I ’ ll take you up on that invitation .  I hope you do . And keep in touch , OK ?  I sure will .  Here ’ s my business card . Send me an email once in a while .  Count on it . And here ’ s my card . Don ’ t hesitate to call me anytime .  Thank you . I ’ d better get going . I don ’ t want to be late for lunch . Mom would worry .  Well , I ’ m really glad we bumped into each other . Have a good trip .  Take good care of yourself , Mary .  I will . Good-bye .  Bye-bye !
