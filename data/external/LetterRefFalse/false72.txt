It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up , then walk around with paper bags or baskets , knocking on the neighbor's  They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy .  That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean ?  Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go  That sounds kind of fun , maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night .  Usually be adults , you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too .  That does sound a lot of fun .
