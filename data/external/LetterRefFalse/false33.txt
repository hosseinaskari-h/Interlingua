Sorry about that . This is the right number , but Heather's not here right now .  Do you know where she went ?  She went to the store to buy some groceries . Would you like to leave a message ?  Yes , would you please tell her Eric Martin called ?  Hi Eric , this is her roommate Kathy . I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party .  Oh , yes . How are you ?  Good .

I saw your ad in The New York Times . I am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it .  We are happy to help you . May I know which one it is ?  The two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street .  Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ?  That's why I think it may suit my needs .  I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed .  The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ?  Yes . But not including the utilities .  Will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month-by-month basis ?  I believe that can be arranged . But there should be a refundable security deposit , you know .  Oh , that's no problem . 
How much is the rent ?  The rent is $ 1500 per month .  And how much is the deposit ?  The deposit is $ 500 . 
Mmm ... it is delicious .  Oh , do you really like it ?  Yes . It's superb .  Well , it's kind of you to say so .  In fact , could I ask you for the recipe ?  Sure . It's really very easy . First , mix together an egg , two teaspoons of salt , and two pounds of ground beef . Then , add two ounces of milk . Are you with me ?  Yes , I've got it .  OK . Next , put the mixture into a baking pan and bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees .  Wait a minute . I didn't catch you there . Could you repeat that ?  Sure . Bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees .  Now , I've got it . Thank you . 
Hello , who's that speaking ?  I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it now ?  Yes , I do .  Is there any furniture in it ?  Yes , it's fully furnished .  What's the rent for a year ?  15,000 Yuan , including water , but electricity and gas .  Where is it located ?  It's in International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes ' walk from the nearest subway station .  That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ?  The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ?  OK . I will be free at tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there .  All right , see you . 
Hey Sarah , I'm having some trouble finding an apartment . Can you help me look at some listings online ?  Sure . What kind of apartment are you looking for ?  Well , it has to be cheap . I don't want a really expensive apartment .  OK . Would you like to live in a studio ?  Sure , a studio would be fine . 
Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ?  Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ?  Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .  That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?  It says it's located in the suburbs . 
Well , this apartment is really a must-see . Will you come with me to look at it this weekend ?  Sure . And if you rent it , maybe I can help you find a roommate too .  Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ?  Yes , my friend Steve . I'll introduce you . 
It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown .  OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive .  I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ?  Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate .  Oh , great idea ! 
Well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro .  Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ?  It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month .  That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well .  That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there . 
I'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised .  Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . And they are all newly renovated .  That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to the downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office .  No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .  I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .  Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there .  Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed address ?  Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place .  Ok . Thank you . 
Good evening , Yanking Restaurant .  Could I reserve a table for Saturday , September 16th at 8: 00 p . m . ?  Certainly , sir . For how many people , please ?  For two people . We would like a quiet table , please .  Of course . May I have your name , please ?  This is Mr . William .  Can you spell that , please ?  William . W-I-L-L-I-A-M .  Thank you , Mr . William . Goodbye . 
A friend told me I might find a room here .  Yes . I'll have a room free next week .  What do you charge ?  12,000 a year , but you can't get visitors to live in .  OK . Would it be all right to look at the room first ?  Could you come back later ? We're right in the middle of dinner . 
I'd like to reserve a table for three this evening .  Just a moment , sir . Let me check the reservation list . Sorry , I'm afraid we're fully booked tonight . Would you like to make a reservation some other time ?  Do you have pot service at noon ?  Yes , the same service and food as in the evening .  OK , we'll come at half past eleven tomorrow .  OK . Your name , please ?  Black .  Good . Thank you very much . 
Can you show me some jade , please ?  Yes , of course . Do you like a jade necklace ?  No , but I do like jade bracelets .  Here are all kinds of jades . Choose whatever you like , please .  Thank you . ( A moment later ) Oh , this one is quite impressive . I'll take it . By the way , do you sell pearl earrings ?  Yes . Natural pearls or cultured pearls ? We have both kinds .  I wonder which looks more lustrous .  Well , natural pearls are of higher value , but the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful .  Oh , I see . I think I prefer a natural one . 
Do you take in students ? I've been told you might have a vacant room .  Yes . If you don't mind sharing room with someone else , there's one available .  How much are you asking ?  800 Yuan a month .  Could I have a look at it , please ?  Sorry , but I'm on my way out now . Could you come back in an hour ? 
I'd like to buy one of these refrigerators . Do I have to pay in cash ?  No , we have an easy-payment plan . One-third down , and the balance in six months .  Fine . Will you work out the details , please ?  Certainly . Would you sit here please ? I'll call our credit manager .  Thank you .  It's just a formality , but for hire purchase we usually require references .  What kind of references do you need ?  Perhaps your employer could supply us with one .  I'm sure he could , but I prefer not to bother him . Would my bank do ?  Certainly . A simple letter from your bank would be quite satisfactory . 
When can I see the one-bedroom apartment ?  There's an open house this weekend .  What time does the open house start ?  It starts at 11AM in the morning . 
I wonder if you can help me . I'm looking for a room .  Yes . I've got a small room .  How much is it ?  200 Yuan a week , but smoking is not allowed .  OK . Can I see the room now ?  Would you mind waiting ? I'm on the telephone . 
Mmmm ... This apartment seems a little expensive . Do you have any cheap studios ?  Actually , the one-bedroom is the only vacant apartment right now .  Do you think any studios will open up soon ?  No , not for a few months .
