I cooked , so ...  Okay ! I'll do the dishes . 
Hello , Mr . Brown .  Hello . Can you help me ?  Yes , I'm here to fix your pipes .  Oh good , come in , please . 
Here comes the bus .  It's about time . 
Can I have this shoe in the black please ?  Of course , sir , I'll have a look in the back .  Okay .  I'm afraid I haven't got one in your size . 
Get up , you lazybones !  Just a minute . 
Shall we start decorating the bedroom ?  I've already started .  When ?  This afternoon . 
How much is this ?  You mean the large one or the small one ?  The large one .  They're on special this week . They've been reduced to five dollars .  Is this the only kind you have ?  No . We have some that are different in style but not in color . They're over there . Do you see the sign ?  Oh , yes . I think I'll look at those over there before I decide .  Very well . Just take your time . 
Why did you stay home today ?  I'm off today . 
My battery's flat in my mobile .  Is that why you didn't return my call ?  And I couldn't find another phone .  That's okay . 
Is there a doctor here ?  No .  Can you call an Ambulance ?  Sure , what's happened ? 
I am a student in Cambridge University . I read your ad , I want to know something more about your room , please ?  It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood .  Is there a bathroom ?  No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago .  It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ?  Certainly , you're welcome anytime .  See you later !  ( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .  Welcome ! Come in , please !  Yes .  This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .  Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !  Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside .  Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?  Anytime you like .  OK . 
I wonder if you could help me ?  Of course , what's the problem ?  Could you take a picture of me to my friend ?  Sure thing . 
You just ran a red light .  Did I ? 
First you add the washing powder then you add the clothes .  I take it you've done this before ?  Yes , for the last 20 years .  Good . 
Good afternoon , sir . Would you like a tea ?  I'd rather have a cup of coffee .  Of course sir , would you like milk and sugar with that ?  Yes , please . Milk and two sugar . 
He's going too slow .  Pass him . 
I stayed at Bob's last night .  I was worried where you were .  I guess I should have told you .  Yes , you should have . 
Are you going to come home late tonight ?  Yes , I've got to work overtime . 
Ah , Bob . Just the person I wanted to see .  So what is it ?  You gotta help me out this time , buddy .  Another tough thing , I guess . 
Hi , Bob , what time will you be home tonight ?  I'll be back late tonight .  Why ? What's the problem ?  I have a meeting with my General Manager .
