Hi Mike . What have you been up to ?  Not much . I started exercising .  Trying to get in shape ?  Yeah , and I need to start improving my health .  Me too . What are you doing besides exercising ?  That's about all .  I think if you eat better , it will help tremendously .  Sleep is good too . I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems .  Looks like there are a lot of things to do to stay healthy .  True . But I think it is worth it . When you get old , you want to be healthy and active . 
Yes , I think there is something wrong with my car .  What's the matter ?  When I tried to back it , I found it was out of order . I can't see where the trouble is .  Let me see .  Is it serious ?  No , the damage is minor .  And when will it be OK ?  4:00 p . m ..  OK . Thank you . 
Mike , I'm afraid I can't come back home for dinner tonight .  Not back home for dinner again ? That's the third time this week !  I'm sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that .  You don't have to explain . Suit yourself .  Please forgive me . You have my word . I'll spend some time with you on the weekend . I promise .  We'll see .  Thank you for understanding . I promise I'll make it up to you . 
May I help you , sir ?  Yes , I'd like to get some gas .  Regular or unleaded ?  Unleaded . My car is new .  How many gallons do you want ?  Fill it up . I will have a tour tomorrow .  All right . Shall I check the oil ?  Yes , please .  You're a quart low .  Give me a quart of light oil .  Yes , sir . 
Damn Scott . You got big .  Yeah , I've been working out a lot .  How long have you been lifting weights ?  For a year and a half .  Yeah . Last time I saw you , it was like 2 years ago .  Has it been that long ?  How often do you go to the gym ?  I usually go every other day for about 3 hours .  That's a lot .  Yeah , I used to work out for an hour a day 4 times a week , and I saw no results . This is what you have to do to get noticeable results .  I don't think I have the discipline for that .  Just think of it as a hobby . Then it's actually fun . 
What do you do besides work and watching TV ?  When I have some time , I like to exercise .  Do you go jogging or do you go to a health club ?  I joined Samsung Health Club a couple of months ago .  How do you exercise ?  I usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the Carpio , and then I lift weight for about 45 minutes .  How often do you go ?  I want to go four times a week , but I'm too lazy . Last week , I only went to workout once . 
What can I do for you ?  I want to get my car washed .  Would you like regular car wash package ?  I don't know what you mean .  Well , we will wash the exterior form top to bottom . We use a special shampoo , which gives the body that extra shine .  Do you wash windows ?  Of course . We wash the windows inside and out .  What about the interior ?  We use a vacuum cleaner that removes all the dirt , and we throw away all of the trash that we can find .  Sounds good , regular car wash package will be OK .  OK . I see . 
This looks wonderful , Madame Culot .  Yes , it's very nice . All our foreign visitors enjoy it . The food is wonderfully well-prepared . Let me know if you need any help with the menu .  Thank you . Mmm . Can you tell me about the terrine ?  Yes . A terrine is a kind of meat pate . It's meat turned into a paste . It sounds horrible but it's actually really good .  Mmm . Maybe another time .  You could try the ravioli . They are rather like your Chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious .  Sounds good . I think I'll have the lamb for my main course . What does it come with ?  Well , you can have fries-French fries-or simple boiled potatoes .  I'll have the potatoes . What are you having ?  I'm having my usual . I like the fish here . Would you like some wine ?  Oh , yes . That would be lovely . 
You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ?  Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week .  Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that . 
Welcome . Can I help you with anything ?  Hi . I'm shopping for my boyfriend's birthday . Do you have any suggestions ?  Let's see . How about a nice shirt and tie ? You can't go wrong there .  Well . He doesn't wear ties that often .  We have some nice pants . You can also get him a belt with it .  That sounds good . Which one do you recommend ?  These slacks are very popular . He can wear them to dress up a little or on a normal casual day .  I like them . Do you have matching belts ?  Yes . Right over here .  How much are they ?  The pants are on sale for $ 40 , and the belt is $ 25 .  What is your return policy just in case he doesn't like them ?  Just save the receipt and we will gladly return or exchange them for you .  That sounds great . I'll take them . 
What happened to your car ?  A tow truck was towing my car and put all those dents in my car .  Are they going to pay you for the damages ?  They're saying it was already there .  What the hell . That doesn't make sense . What are you going to do ?  I have to go to court . A cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there .  That sucks . I'd be pissed if that happened to me .  I got an estimate and it's four thousand dollars .  Oh my gosh . Damn ... screw the court , I would burn down their store .  We'll see what happens after court . 
Excuse me . Can you tell me where the Wal-Mart supermarket is ?  Turn right at the second crossing and then go straight for two blocks .  Is it far from here ?  No , it ’ s only ten-minute's walk .  Thanks a lot .  You ’ re welcome . 
Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the railway station ?  Just go straight along this street , turn left at the first crossing and walk straight ahead about 100 meters . You can ’ t miss it .  About how long will it take me to get there ?  It ’ s about 20 minutes ’ walk , I think .  I see . Is there a bus I can take ?  Yes , you can take the No . 5 bus over there . Get off at the next stop .  Thank you so much for your help .  It ’ s my pleasure . 
Welcome home , Peter !  Thanks , honey . It's great to be back .  So , how was your trip to Thailand ? 
Excuse me . Does this bus go to the National Library of China ?  Yes , there are three stops left .  How long is the ride ?  Well , you will get there in about a quarter of an hour if the traffic isn ’ t too heavy .  Thank you . Would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? I'm a stranger here .  Sure , madam . I ’ ll remind you . 
Where did you get these peanuts , Mike ?  At the supermarket down the street . Help yourself .  Thanks ! 
There's plenty left . Would you like another helping ?  I'd like to have some more . It's really good . 
That was delicious .  There's still a lot left-have some more !  Thanks , but I couldn't eat another bite . I'm really full . 
I'm hungry . Do we have anything to eat ?  Just a few cookies .  That's fine with me . 
Let's take a break .  Good idea . How about a cup of coffee ?  Sounds good .
