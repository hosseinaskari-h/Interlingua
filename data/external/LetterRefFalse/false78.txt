Turn on the TV , please .  OK .  What's wrong with the TV ? It isn't clear and the color's not right .  I don't know . Maybe it's broken .  Can you do something about it ?  I'll see if I can adjust it .  That's better , but it's still not quite right .  Why not tell the clerk and ask them to repair it .  Good idea . 
You have any ideas as to what you want to do this weekend ?  I'm going to the movie theater with my friend . What are you going to do ?  I'm not quite sure yet .  How about you see a movie with me and my friend ?  What movie are you and your friend planning on watching ?  Not sure . Is there a movie out that catches your eye ?  No good movies come to mind .  Have you decided whether or not you would like to go ?  No , thanks . Maybe another time .  For sure another day . 
I've enjoyed conversing with you .  Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ?  I've got to go .  I wasn't done talking to you .  I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey .  I'm not being nosey . I'm just asking .  I really don't think it's any of your business .  That's not nice .  I apologize , but I'm getting off the phone now .  Okay . 
Do you know what you're going to do this weekend ?  I am going to see a movie with a friend of mine . What about you ?  I don't know .  Would you like to see a movie with me and my friend ?  Do you know what movie you're going to watch ?  I don't know , but was there a certain movie you wanted to see ?  None that I can think of .  Well , would you like to go ?  Thank you for inviting me , but I think I'll pass .  All right . Another time then . 
Oh hi , Linda , this is Todd .  Yes , Todd , how nice to hear your voice !  Linda , I just wanted to say that I had a wonderful evening with you last Friday .  I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd .  I had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in the mountains on Saturday .  Hiking would be perfect ! May I bring along a picnic lunch for us to share ?  A picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along .  I'll work on the lunch , and you can work out the details of where we will go . What time will you be at my house ?  Nine would be good , don't you think ?  Nine is good . See you on Saturday ! 
Linda , this is Todd calling .  Todd , I am so happy you called !  Linda , I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our time together last Friday night .  Boy , Todd , that was one great movie you picked out ! Thanks for asking me to go with you !  I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday .  A hike would be great ! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch , OK ?  Linda , that would be a perfect addition .  I'll take care of the lunch then , and you can take care of the other plans . What time would you like to pick me up ?  I was hoping to leave by 9 o'clock so that it won \ ' t be too hot for the hike .  Nine is a great time to get started . I'll see you on Saturday ! 
Well , it was nice talking to you .  It was nice talking to you too .  We should really hang out again .  That would be fun .  Where do you want to go ?  I think we should go out to eat .  That sounds good .  All right , so I'll see you then .  I'll call you later .  Okay , I'll talk to you later then .  See you later .  Bye . 
I'll talk to you later .  What's the rush ?  I have to get off the phone now .  I'm not ready to get off the phone with you .  There are other things I need to take care of .  What is it that you need to do ?  Please don't be nosey .  I'm not being nosey , it's just a question .  You don't need to worry about that .  That was mean to say .  I am very sorry , but I must go .  I guess . 
I enjoyed talking to you .  I enjoyed talking to you too .  We should hang out some time .  I think that would be nice .  Is there anything you would like to do next time ?  Do you want to go out to eat ?  I'd like that .  So I'll see you next time .  I'm going to call you soon .  I'll talk to you later .  See you soon .  Goodbye . 
Hi Linda , this is Todd .  Todd , good to hear from you !  I just wanted to tell you what a great time I had with you at the movies last week .  Me too , Todd ! Thanks for suggesting that great movie .  I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the mountains with me on Saturday .  I would love to join you on a hike . Could I maybe bring a picnic lunch for us to eat on the trail ?  Sure Linda , that's a great suggestion .  Fine then , what time are we going to leave ?  I was thinking maybe 9 o'clock or so , so that we could get started before the heat gets too bad .  Nine would be perfect . I'll see you then ! 
John , I was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year .  I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend , Mark .  What are you talking about ?  What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation ?  You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us !  Really ? Who made that rule up ?  With that attitude , I don't really think we have much more to discuss here .  That works for me ! 
Joe , how are you doing ?  I am great ! How about you , Mary ? How are you ?  I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe .  I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ?  I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .  OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ?  What were you planning on seeing ?  I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .  How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ?  That's a chick flick ! 
Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year , John .  I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska .  Are you kidding me ?  You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ?  We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together .  I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ?  Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well !  I am really looking forward to getting away from you . Far away from you ! 
Do you enjoy going on dates ?  Yes . I find dates to be a lot of fun .  What's so fun about them ?  They give me the opportunity to get to know someone better .  So you always have fun on dates ?  Not always . I don't always like the person I'm on the date with .  Why not ?  My date may not be my type .  So then why would you ask them out in the first place ?  I didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type .  Sounds like a huge waste of time to me .  Now that I think about it , it really is sometimes . 
John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year .  I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska .  You can't be serious !  Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .  After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .  Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .  You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all !  Whatever you say ! 
Hi Joe , how are you doing today ?  Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ?  Things are going well for me , Joe .  Want to go see a movie tonight ?  My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .  Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?  What movie did you want to see ?  There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .  I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”  Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to ! 
Hi Kara , it's Mike here .  Hi Mike , how are you doing ?  I'm doing well , and you ?  Everything is going great .  Kara , would you be interested in going to dinner again this Friday ?  Mike , I had a good time too , but I am getting ready to move back to the east coast , so I think I shouldn't get too involved right now .  Well , we could just go out as friends .  Right now , I think I need to really focus on matters at home , but thanks for a nice evening . 
Hello , this is Mike , Kara .  Mike ! Good to hear from you . How are you ?  Everything is fine , and how are you ?  Things are going well with me .  Kara , I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this Friday .  Mike , I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again . I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home .  Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something .  I can't really deal with any distractions right now , but I appreciate the nice evening we spent together . 
Hey Joe , how have you been ?  I am doing well . How about you , Mary ?  I am doing OK , Joe .  There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see . Want to go with me ?  I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her .  I could go to the movies on Friday night instead . Would that be better ?  Did you have a certain movie in mind ?  I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice .  I kind of wanted to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”  Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie ! 
What's up ?  Nothing much , what's going on ?  I'm having a party this Friday .  Oh , really ? That's nice .  I wanted to see if you wanted to come .  This Friday ? Sorry , I already have plans .  Doing what ?  I'm going to dinner with my family .  I really wanted you to come , but I understand .  Yeah , maybe next time .  I'll hold you to that .  Sounds like a plan .
