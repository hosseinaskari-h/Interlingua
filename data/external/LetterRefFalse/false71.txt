Kate , you never believe what's happened .  What do you mean ?  Masha and Hero are getting divorced .  You are kidding . What happened ?

That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?  Early in the New Year I guess .
