Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ?  I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired .  Late night ?  Yeah , I got home around two . 
Hey , Devi , have you thought about where would you like to go to dinner on Friday for your birthday ?  I am not sure . I don't know that many restaurants around here .  You know , we could look online at the local Internet sites .  Good . Let's take a look !  What kind of food would you like ?  I enjoy Thai or Japanese the best .  This one , Shogun , looks good .  Oh yes , I've heard of that one . Everyone I've spoken with says that it is great !  Would you like to go there then ?  I think that that would be a really good choice ! Let's call and make a reservation . 
Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while .  I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back .  Where were you ?  I was in New York for a wedding . 
I ’ m really glad I got a chance to talk to you before you left , Mary . Have a safe trip !  Thanks . Try not to work too hard while I ’ m away !  Yeah , I ’ ll try not to ! See you after Christmas .  Okay-bye ! Have a nice Christmas . 
Devi , do you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner for your birthday ?  I don't really know where I want to go . I am having trouble thinking of a particular restaurant .  There is a great restaurant directory here in the weekend section of the newspaper .  OK , we could look at that .  Do you have a particular type of food that you would like ?  I really like Japanese or Thai food .  That Japanese restaurant , Shogun , got good reviews .  Oh yeah ! I saw a review of that restaurant on television . The reviewer loved it !  Would that be a place that you might like to go to for your birthday ?  That would work out great ! Why don't we call and get a reservation ? 
Well , I guess that ’ s about it . Everything ’ s packed and ready to go .  It ’ s hard to believer you ’ re really retiring . What are you going to do with yourself ?  Have fun ! I plan to spend some more time with my grandkids , and I might even go back to school .  Well , good luck . Give me a ring sometime , and let me know how you are . 
Hello , Mr . Macmillan .  Hi , Susan . How are you feeling today ?  Much better , thanks .  Glad to hear it . 
Did you enjoy the restaurant ?  I didn't really like it all that much .  What do you think the problem was ?  Well , they are pretty new . I just didn't feel that they were ready to open yet .  How did you feel about the food ?  The food wasn't all that exciting .  I don't think that the service was good , either .  Yes , the service certainly didn't add to the experience .  Would you like to return to this restaurant ?  Maybe we could try it again in a few months when things have settled down .
