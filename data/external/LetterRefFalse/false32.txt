May I have a reservation ?  Yes , of course .  I've got three guests today . We'd like a table next to the window .  All right . Your name , please .  I'm Chen Liang .  Chen Liang , a table for four . And when are you coming ?  We may come at 6:30 p . m .  OK . We look forward to seeing you . Goodbye .  Goodbye . 
What are you doing ?  I'm watching TV .  Are there any good programs on TV ?  Tingling is on TV .  Which Channel is it ?  Channel 8 .  It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ? 
I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls .  Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor .  Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor .  Are you sure ?  Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful .  Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ?  Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up .  Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ?  Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right .  And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in .  Sure . If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . I can get all the carpet out this weekend . 
Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ?  Yes . May I help you ?  Yes . I'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . Can you arrange it for us ?  Just a minute . I'll check if there is any availability . I'm sorry , sir . There isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . Would you like to make a reservation at that time ?  Let me see . It seems a little late .  Usually , the restaurant will be quieter at that time .  OK . I'll change the time to 8: 00 .  Very good , sir . A table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . May I have your name , please ?  It's John .  Thank you very much . Bye . 
Do you live in the red house at the end of the road ?  Yes , I live in that house with my parents and my sister .  We also have a cat and a dog .  Do you take your dog for a walk every day ?  No . My father takes the dog for a walk every Monday , Tuesday and Sunday .  And I take the dog for a walk every Wednesday , Thursday and Friday .  Who takes the dog on Saturday ?  On Saturday we all go to the park and the dog comes with us .  Do you help with the housework ?  My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room . 
You're right . Watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . I like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast .  I agree . And it's very convenient .  Have you ever heard of a movie rental company called Netflix ? They send the movies directly to your house in the mail .  Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time .  Yeah , but I wish they delivered video games too . Then I would never leave my house ! 
Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ?  I am cooking now !  Are you good at cooking ?  I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !  It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !  I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?  Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty .  That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .  I have the same idea as yours .  It's OK . Please have a taste of it .  Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .  Thank you for your praise .  Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?  I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .  So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ?  Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .  Thanks a lot .  It's my pleasure . 
Alright , tell me what you think about this one .  Don't you think it's a bit bright ?  Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ?  That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ?  No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated .  I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own .  How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?  That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?  That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .  Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?  Yep . Here it is . What do you think ?  That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?  The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it . 
Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down .  I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you .  That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ?  No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon . 
Boy , come here !  Yes , sir ! What can I do for you ?  Bring me a cup of coffee , please .  Will you have it strong or weak ?  I prefer strong . 
Won't you have some of this ?  Yes , thanks .  It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .  It's very good . How do you make it ?  I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .  This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .  I'm glad you like it .  You Americans usually have nutritious food .  Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?  We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .  I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night . 
Here , Let me get the door for you .  Thanks .  Do you need a hand with that ?  Actually , I could use some help . Thank you so much .  Don't worry about it . 
Doctor , my child is nine years old , and I recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school .  Is he doing very well at school ?  He is doing OK , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies .  What's his problem ?  This may be complicated . But I think he may need to build up his self-esteem .  How can his he do that ?  There are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem , but to begin with , you can try and give him more rewards . Rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem . 
Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .  What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them .  But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .  Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . 
There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ?  I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper .  What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ?  I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market .  I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . 
Good morning , Mrs . Smith .  Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother .  What kind of books does she like ?  She's very fond of detective stories . 
Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?  Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk .  Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .  I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .  Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?  Nothing .  What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .  Promise that you won't get angry .  OK , I promise . What is it ?  It's a kitty .  Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .  Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble .  No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .  Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame .  All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .  I will . Thank you , Mummy . 
There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide .  You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds .  But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it .  To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue . 
Hello , do you have any vacancies ?  Yes , something just opened up .  What kind of apartment is it ?  It's a one-bedroom , one-bathroom apartment . 
What kind of films do you like best ?  I like feature films best . How about you ?  I don't like feature films . I think sometimes it loses contact with reality . I like to see some documentary films . What kind of feature films do you like best ?  I always like to see the oldies , like The Sound of Music , Gone with the Wind . They are realty the best - in the acting , the scene and the plot .  You are sort of romantic .
