Chinese tea is famous all over the world . I want to buy several boxes .  There are various kinds of tea in China . It depends on the taste and effect .  Well , I do not know Chinese tea at all .  This is green tea , you can drink it in summer . It can relieve summer-heat and it is good for maintaining your lungs .  Sounds interesting . What about this ?  It is black tea , it has a strong taste and promotes digestion .  What's this ? It smells fragrant .  It is jasmine tea of high quality . It is fragrant and has a pleasant taste .  I will take the jasmine tea . Could you pack it with the wrapping paper and ribbon ? It is a gift for my friend .  No problem . Wait for a moment . 
Can I help you ?  I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ?  Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food .  Moon cakes ? What is that ?  The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony .  Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people .  All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style .  What's the difference between these two styles ?  The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts .  Get me some of each .  OK , here you are . 
Why is there water all over the bathroom floor ?  I'm sorry - it's my fault . I was filling the bathtub and I left the water running too long , so it overflowed .  That's OK . As long as you clean it up . 
Excuse me , I have something to trouble you .  Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you .  An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist .  Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?  I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .  Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?  Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .  It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?  All right . Thank you .  Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully .  Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .  I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .  Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing . 
Ann , it's terrible !  What's up ?  Look , this is a pimple !  Oh , I think it is .  How come ?  I think it's because of your bad habits !  I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot .  I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem .  I wasn't aware of that !  You should do better later . 
Hello ? Can you give me a tow ? My tour car's stranded .  Sure . Where are you ?  I'm on highway 1-75 going near exit 46 .  What kind of car ?  It's a blue Nissan minivan .  Where are you going to ?  The closest garage . What's the charge ?  You are within 50 kilometers , so it's a 50 - dollar flat rate .  How long will it take ?  About 20 to 30 minutes .  Thanks . 
How's your new car ?  Perfect ! Couldn't be better .  You made a good choice , then ?  It's just what I want .  No regrets ?  I am really pleased with it .  I am glad you are happy .  It's super . 
Would you like to see our new shirts ?  Sorry , but I'm not really that interested in those things .  Well , they are very nice you know .  Really ?  And not expensive either .  Oh , I don't care about that .  Everybody is buying them .  Are they ?  Yes , they are very fashionable , you see .  I am afraid I am not interested in fashion .  I see .  But thank you very much all the same .  Sorry I couldn't help you . 
Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning .  Where did he go ?  I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes .  Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future .  Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .  Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work .  In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ?  That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ?  That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . 
What is this big box at the front door ?  Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print .  What did you get yourself into ?  I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months .  So , what's in the box ? A fridge ?  It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes .  I guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you !  Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ? 
What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps .  I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn .  Calm down ! Shouting won â€™ t help ?  He is really outrageous .  What happened ?  I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me .  What ? He can't do this to you .  Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .  What did you do ?  I shouted it back of course .  Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ?  What would you do if you were in my shoes ?  Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him .  No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault .  I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate .  I am too angry to do that . 
How can I help you ?  I'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend .  Do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?  She usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance .  OK , here are some of our most popular perfumes .  Which one would you recommend ?  Personally , I quite like the new perfume from Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ?  That smells great . I'll take one bottle , please .  Would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .  It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy .  How about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .  She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big .  How about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger .  No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is .  I know what she would like-some whitening cream .  No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter .  Will that be all then ?  That will be all . You've been very helpful , thanks . 
Good morning , madam . Can I help you ?  I want to buy some cleansing milk . What would you recommend ?  Your complexion is on the oily side . I suggest you use cleansing gel .  Anything that can keep my skin clean will do .  How do you prefer this one ? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy .  Hm ... the smell is too strong , I can't stand it . I'm very sensitive to fragrance .  We've also got a fragrance-free one , specially designed for sensitive skin . I'm sure you'll like it .  I'll try that . Do you have facial cream to go with that ?  Yes , sure . This line of products is fragrance-free . We have a facial mask , moisturizing lotion , eye cream and tonic .  I'll buy the moisturizing lotion and cleansing gel first . If they suit me , I'll come back for the others later .  Thank you very much , madam . Here are some samples of our products . Do try them out . 
What did you buy at the market ?  I bought some special local products .  You seem to have bought the whole market !  Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut .  Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals .  Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ?  All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes .  Then I will buy some tomorrow .  Why do you want to buy so much ?  Because I want to send them to my friends .  I see . 
Are there pets allowed in this apartment ?  No dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed .  What about a boa constrictor ?  Well . . . is that a pet ? Isn't that something from the zoo ?  If I had one , could I rent this apartment ?  I was more thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock .  What about a Gila monster ?  I'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here . 
Dad , can I have a pet ? I did what you said and passed all of my exams .  Then I guess you get to have a pet . Do you know what you want ?  I want a dog . My friend Mindy's dog just had puppies and she said I can have one .  You know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff ?  I know , I know . I will do it all by myself .  Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ?  Yes . It will cost me about $ 50 a month . And I make a little more than that already .  Sounds like you've done your homework . I think you're ready for this . 
Beth , would you like me to help you carry it ?  Thanks , but I don't want to put you into any trouble .  Don't be silly . It's no trouble at all . 
I think this painting would look good in our living room . What do you think ?  Sure . Let's buy it . 
Help ! I'm about to drop these books .  I've got them .  Thanks ! 
What can I do for you ?  I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . Could you make a recommendation for me ?  I'd like to . How do you like the hat ?  It's not special . It can be seen everywhere .  How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful .  It's interesting . Let me see .  Do you like it ?  Yes , how much is it ?  Fifty yuan .  OK , I'll take it .
