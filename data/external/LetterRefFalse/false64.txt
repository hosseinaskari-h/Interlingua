Yo , G.How are you getting along with your classmates in the English training school ?  Not bad . Everything goes well .

The bracelet is so well suited to you . It looks very nice .  Yeah , I cherish it . Because I have been working like a dog for two months to buy it . 
Honey , how is by you ?  Just so so.There are no exciting things for me . 
Did you listen to the weather forecast ?  No.Why ?  There ’ s a typhoon coming .  No way !  Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night .

Last trip was very terrible . I hope everything will be fine this time . Don ’ t blow it .  Trust me . Everything will go well . 
Hey , let ’ s go to the night market after work tonight .  That ’ s a good idea . I haven ’ t been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread !  That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . 
We ’ re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow . Feel like coming along ?  Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race .  Really ? I think you ’ ll love it .  As long as I don ’ t have to row . 
Wow ! What ’ s the hold up ?  It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer .  Really ?

I always seem to find something .

What was the biggest turing point in your life ?  I usee I would say that would be moving out of my parents ’ house for the first time .  Really ? Why is that ?  Till I moved out of my parents ’ home , I became a lot more independent .  What would you say was the lowest point in your life ?  That would definitely be getting a divorce .  What went wrong ?  We just weren't right for each other .  How long were you married ?  The marriage only lasted about a year .  Have you remarried since then ?

Oh I hope not , my first marriage was a mistake , but this one isn ’ t .  How long have you been married ?  About 15 years now .  Do you think you'll still love him when he is old and gray ?  I think so , hopefully we ’ ll have a long and a happy life together .  I ’ m sure you will . 
How many people are there in your family ?  My immediate family is quite small . It's just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . How about you ?  I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and my parents .  I didn't know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ?  We're identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else !  Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ?  We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn't mention to your biological father .  I don't know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family .  What about your step-brother's mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ?  No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later .  Sounds like it was ment to be .
