He dresses in plain clothes and drives an old car . Who would know he is the richest man in town ?  You can't judge a book by its cover . 
Those guys thought they would never lose . But we finally beat them . And look at them crying now .  The bigger they are , the harder they fall . 
I feel I work harder when I am under pressure .  Me too . I get much more done when I am under the gun . 
There has been talk at school about canceling the concert .  Really ? Who did you hear that from ?  Just word of mouth . 
Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ?  No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder . 
I was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me .  Great minds think alike . 
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean .  Would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it .  I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage .  What do you mean ?  Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together .  I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .  People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do .  I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings .  I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .  The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful .  Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .  You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! 
I ’ d love to have my own farm .  It would be very hard work . Are you sure ?  I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy .  Running a farm would be totally different to you current job .  That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office .  You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into .  My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields .  Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . 
What ’ s your city like ?  It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls .  Is the traffic bad in the city centre ?  Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good .  What about restaurants and entertainment ?  There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many s  Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ?  There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas .  It sounds like a really exciting city to live in .  It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . 
Is your city a historical place ?  Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village .  How did it grow into such a large place ?  Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .  As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby .  Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .  I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?  Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too .  Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . 
Do you believe in UFO's ?  Sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs .  I've never thought about it like that before .  I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up .  Do you think that there's life on other planets ?  I think there must be .  Why is that ?  I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that .  Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ?  No , but we're trying to contact them .  I suppose you're right .  I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct .  Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ?  There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . 
I haven't met you at the gym for a long time .  yeah , I quit my job , and started working from home . Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out .  why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening .  it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night .  then SOHO is your ideal work style .  yeah , as long as I have a computer and internet access , I can start working . I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace .  and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control .  absolutely . I can decide when and what to do all by myself .  sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ?  yeah , I can find enough online .  it's good to have business around . But you should also do some exercise to keep fit .  thank you for reminding me . I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project . 
Hello , Jim . What was the film like ?  Awful . It was a complete waste of time .  Why ? What was it about ?  It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own .  A lot of young people have to do that .  Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired .  lt sounds like the story of my life .  Yes , it does , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night .  I take sleeping pills sometimes .  Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital .  It sounds a very depressing film .  Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end ,  I don't know . My wife used to speak French . I must tell her to brush it up .

My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked .  I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's .  OK , catch you later . 
What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .  I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .  come on , nothing can be that bad .  but promise me , you'll keep it a secret .  ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?  I've fallen in love with my boss .  really ? Is he married ?  no , of course not . He is still single .  then what's your problem ?  I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .  oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .  worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .  office romance is very tricky .  it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .  cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . 
Mike , what are you doing tonight ?  Nothing special . I just want to get plastered .  I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's .  YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span .  Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's .  On second thought , I think I'll join you .  They ' Ve just renovated the place . You may be surprised .  Wow , they really went to town on this place !  Quite a difference , huh ?  Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please .  Ah hah.Thought you were't drinking .  When in Rome , do as the Romans do . 
hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came .  of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .  yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .  how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ?  oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn  yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better  oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .  definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .  sounds great ! I'll be there . 
how's it going ?  I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ?  to be honest , I'm a bit fed up .  what's wrong ?  there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around .  I see ! Do you want to ask her out ?  sure , but how ?  you can ask her out for drink after work .  but for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am .  then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first .  easier said than done .  you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her .  but I always get tongue-tied when I see her .  that's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased .  I see . I'll try .  good luck ! 
Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?  yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .  good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .  yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...  is everything ready now ?  almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .  have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .  yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .  it's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .  that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .  I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .  thank you .  my pleasure . 
how are you doing , Christopher ?  to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break !  are you doing anything this weekend ?  I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !  are you available on Sunday ?  yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .  ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?  that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?  it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .  what should I bring with me ?  we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .  I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .  do you like surfing ?  I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?  we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !  I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?  you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .  ok , where and when should I meet you ?  we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !
