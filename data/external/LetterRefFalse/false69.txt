Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ?  Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets !  Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun !  I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ?

You look really wiped out .  I had meetings back to back all morning . Then the printer broke in the middle of putting together the Six Soap presentation , and the phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office .  Not a good day , I hate to tell you that Mr . Emory wants to see the designs for the Polish Paste Ad tomorrow morning .  I can ’ t believe it ! I guess I ’ ll be here until ten again tonight !

Hello Mary . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Are you still seeing Paul ?  No . We broke up last month . I ’ m taking a break from dating for a while .  Did you break up amicably ? Sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up .  We just decided to stop seeing each other . It was all very amicable . Are you still going out with mike ?  Yes , I am . We ’ re thinking about getting engaged . We ’ Ve been dating for over a year now .  Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ?  I havn't seen her for a while.She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her.He was seeing a girl form his office.One day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .  She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon .  Really ? They ’ Ve been together for a long time . When are they getting married ?  I think it ’ s 26th September . I ’ ll check and make sure that Tina remembers to invite you to the hen night .  Thanks . Hey , look at that guy over there . I think he fancies you .  He certainly looks interested , doesn ’ t he ? Shall we invite him over to our table ? 
Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party .  Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ?  Her birthday is on the 9th .

How are you wedding plans going ?  Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress .  When will that be ready ?  The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks .  You ’ re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ’ Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .  Yes . We ’ Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .  Which hotel will the reception be held at ?  The palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job .  Oh , yes . It ’ s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .  Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .  I think you make the right decision . 
How many people are in your family ?  As you know , china has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and I . What about in your family ?  I have one daughter and one son . Then there ’ s my husband and I . What about your parents ? Do they live with your family ?  Not anymore . They live with my brother now . and yours ?  My parents live by themselves now . When they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ?  No , I have two older brothers and one younger sister . What about you ?  I also grew up in a big family . I have one older brother and three younger sisters .  How long have you been married ?  About seven years now . and you ?  I ‘ Ve been married for about five years . What do you think about divorce ?  It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ?  If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , I would get a divorce .  If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws !  ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband .  Of course not ! 
That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ?  Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who are not too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her .  I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered .  He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that .  Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?  I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair .  We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls-probably because I ’ m so tall myself .  Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?  No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ?  Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend .  I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you .

How old is Keith ?  He's 21 . How old is James ?  He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger .  How's your father ?  He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .  He can spend more time with his grandchildren .  Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .  So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !  How do you want to spend your old age ?  In the same way , probably . 
What's the life expectancy in your country ?  I'm not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?  About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world .  I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .  Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .  Did she ? That's great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the environment .  How's your son these days ?  Oh , he's fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .  He'll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ?  I had mine when I was 24 . That's a little young . I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .  Yes , I think you're right . I'm thinking about having a child , but not just yet .  Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in your country ?  Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life.Parents usually try to discour  Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom .  It's almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . 
I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me .  what did you argue about ?  he borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet .  well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair .  yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .  did you lend him a lot of money ?  not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .  well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything r  no , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up .  of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? 
what kind of qualities do you look for in your friends ?  I like people who are open and friendly . Those people are usually more active and fun to be with . I like spending time with my friends . We go to bars together or play sports together .  I don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest . Honesty is very important to me .  I think it ’ s important to most people . The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them .  you can find out from their friends .  if you know any of their friends . You can ’ t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . You have to go out and make the first move sometimes . I also like funny people .  oh , I don ’ t . they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously . You never know when they are joking and when they are being serious .  sometimes it can be hard to tell , but if you know the person fairly well , you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking .  it seems that we generally like different kinds of people . How is it that we are such good friends ?  maybe people don ’ t like to have friends that are all the same . Most people like a little variety in their lives-including a variety of characteristics in their friends . 
When you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ?  I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ?  I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill .  That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .  That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ?  Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill .  Did you ? How is he these days ?  He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other .  I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ?  Of course . What do you want to move first ?  Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . 
Do you like Barry ?  No , not very much . He's too ambitious and dishonest .  I agree . I like his brother Paul . They are not alike .  Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .  What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?  I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy .  Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .  Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first.Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy !  You're right . I love going out and making new friends .  So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ?  Of course ! 
Are you going to helen ’ s birthday party on Friday evening ?  I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?  If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze . But a few people said that they couldn ’ t go . So I think it should be OK ?  Are you taking anything ?  I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too .  That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbors don ’ t mind too much .  Helen gets on very well with her neighbors . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too .  I ’ m really looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast !  Well , don ’ t be late . I ’ ll see you on Friday at helen ’ s .
