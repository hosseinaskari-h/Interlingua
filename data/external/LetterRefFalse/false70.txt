that was a great party . Thanks for saying behind to help me clear up .  it certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .  I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ?  I doubt it , I ‘ ll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .  I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .  afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks .  yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too .  Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious .  I think that she had a litter too much of the punch .  what did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong .  that ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks and I prepared ?  very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .  that cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ?  all cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up . 
so , tell me about your new house . How is it different to your old one ?  well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course !  so , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ?  yes . One bedroom is for my wife and i . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on  what ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook .  that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large .  are the rooms nice and bright ?  yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows .  do you have a balcony ?  no , we don ’ t . we wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .  you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ?  it ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or yo 
so , your friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift .  my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b  that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ?  most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help  so , what did you get them ?  I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .  what ’ s wrong with is ?  she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise .  household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays .  I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten year 
Do you do a lot of your shopping online ?  Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat  No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ?  Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho  I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological .  I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people .  So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .  Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something .  Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite .

I had forgotten to get mine .

Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?  It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive .  We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .  Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around .  That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus .  Really ? I think you see more traveling by train .  So which form of transport do you prefer to use ?  I prefer going by train , even though it costs more .  Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?  The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .  We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive .
