What are the seasons like in your city ?  Summers is hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime .  Does it ever rain in summer ?  We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then .  What are spring and autumn like ?  I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny an  Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our wine  Do you usually go on a summer holiday ?  No , I don ’ t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm .  I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city . 
There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ?  I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late .  We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries  Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking a  In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow e  It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people .  Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment .  I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . 
What do you do in summer ?  I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ?  I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book .  What do you do in winter ?  Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter .  I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer-you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter .  Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze !  Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ?  Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! 
I was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting .  I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .  The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .  Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation .  Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .  Can you ride a horse ?  Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ?  I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?  What a good idea ! 
What's the weather like in your city ?  In the summer it gets very hot.the temperature is often between 37 and 40 centigrade.when it is hot we often get rains.the winters are drier .  The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city.the rain falls mostly in the winter.and we often get snow .  What are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .  In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that.the streets are often icing in the morning.with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .  Yeah , we do . in the middle of summer there can be thunderstorms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ?  We do have a few foggy days in winter.but i would not say we have a lot of fogs.the sky are usually clearly over your city , are they ?  Yes , they are . like i said we have thunderstorms.but each one usually only last a few hours.then the skys are clear again .  Have you ever had snow in your city ?  My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child.but my parents and i only see it outside of our city .  The river in my city sometime freeze over.people go ice-skating on it.on summer people go boating on the river.but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .  As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean.but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot in sunny . 
Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ?  My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country .  Is it really completely flat ?  Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .  Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .  The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .  That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs .  There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes .  We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . 
Is there a lot of crime in your city ?  There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime .  It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .  That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for  Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach .  I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others .  That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . 
Which countries have you been to ?  I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada .  I thought you had been to Australia too .  No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ?  I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains .  Isn ’ t it really cold there ?  Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter .  I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . 
When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say .  What do the Romans do ?  They live in Rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk .  In other words , the Romans do what everyone else does .  Yes , but they do it differently . Everything is different .  What do you mean ?  Well , the climate's different for a start . It doesn't rain so much as it does in England . The sun shines more often .  I envy them the sun .  I know . You hate the rain , don't you ?  I certainly do .  And a Roman really Ioves life . Eye knows how to enjoy himself .  They always eat spaghetti and drink wine , don't they ?  Not always . But they like a good meal . Lots of tourists go to Rome just for the food , you know .  Really ? How much does it cost to fly to Rome ?  I don't know exactly , but it costs a lot of money . 
Hello , Jim . Where are you going ?  To the cinema . What about coming with me ?  No , thanks . I'm going home . My wife's expecting me .  What a pity . I believe it's a very good film .  Do you go to the cinema a lot ?  Once a week . Most nights I sit at home and watch telly  Do you know what's on tonight by any chance ?  No , I'm sorry I don't . I never read the papers till I get home .  Oh , I see . By the way , where are you going for your holidays this year ?  I don't know yet . My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . She Livesay the sea , you know .  Oh , does she ? That's convenient .  Yes , but I want to go to the country .  Don't you like the sea ?  Yes , very much . But I need peace and quiet when I'm on holiday . What are coughing to do ?  I'm going to stay at home .  Aren't you going to have a holiday abroad this year ?  No , I want to buy a car , and that's going to take every penny I've got . 
Let's play chess .  I haven't played chess for a long time .  That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play .  Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing .  You're a very good player  Not really , but once I won a prize .  So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .  My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously . 
What was the party like last night , Jean ?  Not bad at all , thanks . There were one or two interesting people there.Why couldn't you come ?  Well , I couldn't get away from work early . And when . I got home I had a headache , so I had to go straight to bed . But I was over-tired , because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours .  What a shame . Why didn't you take a sleeping pill ?  I don't like them . I used to take them when I had to work overtime , you know .  How many did you use to take ?  Three every night .  Good heavens . Why did you take so many ?  Because I was under a terrible strain . The doctor saidthey weren't very strong . Anyway , I used to feel awful the next morning .  I'm sure you did .  The doctor said I had to be careful .  He was quite right .  So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead . 
Wake up sleepyhead.The sun is beginning to shine . What a lovely summer day !  Yeah , clearly blue sky.But it is a bit too hot for me . I don't like heat and humidity .  It's not that hot . It's cooler than yesterday . Let's go swimming !  That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned .  Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini .  There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are .  Who cares ! Well , the smart guys get there early . That's the kind of guy I want to meet . Let's go !  If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini , then I want to wear one , too .  Ok , you could borrow one of mine .  Thanks , how about the green and black one ?  No problem . Here it is . 
When was America discovered , Tony ?  I'm not certain . Do you know ?  America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 .  In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ?  All right . Ask me a question now .  Who invented the electric light bulb ?  That's easy . It was invented by Edison .  Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ?  I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .  Ask me a question now .  All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ?  That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ? 
It's a beautiful day , isn't it ?  Yes , isn't it .  Do you now the temperature today ?  It's beautiful 75 degrees .  How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend .  Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees .  What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home .  I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans .  That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . 
Where are you going for your holidays , Charles ?  To Australia . I'm going to visit my uncle in Brisbane for three weeks .  Good gracious ! You certainly are lucky . How are you going there ?  By air , of course . It takes over two weeks to go by sea .  I once went to Singapore by air . It was very exciting-but never again .  Why ? Did you feel frightened ?  For a short time . One of the engines caught fire .  What did the pilot do ?  He put it out and flew back to the airport . Then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was .  Did you land safely ?  Yes , we did . But I shall never fly again . 
We've got a new manager in our department .  Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ?  Yes , I did .  I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ?  Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too  Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ?  Because I'm the wrong sex , of course !  You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ?  Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair .  What sort of clothes does he wear ?  A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ?  Perhaps that had something to do with it .  You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ?  It's possible , isn't it ?  Do you really think I should wear different clothes ?  Well . . . perhaps you should think about it .  Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ?  I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all !  Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing !  Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company . 
I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows .  I see . But Jane . He ’ s not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life . 
do you believe in UFO's ?  sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs .  I've never thought about it like that before .  I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up .  do you think that there's life on other planets ?  I think there must be .  why is that ?  I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that .  do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ?  no , but we're trying to contact them .  I suppose you're right .  I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct .  do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ?  there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . 
You have drank dozens of cups . You are bound to get a bay window .  Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed .
