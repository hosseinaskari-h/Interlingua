You are too picky .  No , I'm not.Hey , look at that guy over there .  Which guy ?  The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window .  I can't see him . Where ?  Right there .  Oh , I see him now . Wait ! That's ...  Yes , it's Mel Gibson .  Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ?  I don't know . Why don't you go ask for his autograph ?  I can't do that .  Why not ? 
I'm not comfortable about this , Sandy . I don't understand most of these games .  That's okay . I can explain a little .  I don't want to lose all my money .  Don't worry . You can't lose all your money.because you won't gamble all your money .  I guess you're right .  Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ?  Yes , I remember.You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play .  That's right . That's the best way to have control over yourself.You say to yourself . Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars . Only fifty dollars . No more.If you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars .  I know it's true , Sandy . But still some people lose control.They start to gamble , and they can't stop .  But I won't let you do that . I will watch you .  Okay .  So how much do you want to gamble ?  Maybe 500 dollars .  500 dollars ! That's too much ! You just said you are afraid to lose your money.If you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ?  I don't want people to think I'm stingy .  That is a bad attitude to have , Karen ! If you think that way , Las Vegas will be really dangerous for you . 
Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ?  You can buy some of these nice butterflies .  No , I'm sorry . I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.It is kind of disgusting .  What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ?  Yes . I think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . It is a kind of destruction of nature .  Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population .  Who knows ? Hey , I like these jade bears here .  How much are they ?  This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ?  If you want . Didn't you buy her a small vase already ?  Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this .  Alright . Buy it then . I won't buy anything . Well , maybe I'll buy some Cognac .  Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother . He always drinks it .  Let's go ask about it . 
So how much should I gamble ?  Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ?  Okay . One-hundred then . Do you think I will lose it ?  I don't know . You have to be smart , but you have to be lucky too.Some games are all luck . With some , you need to be smart .  I want games that are all luck .  I knew you would say that ! Then you should play the slot machines .  Slot machines ? No , I don't want that ! That's too boring . I want a game with cards or dice .  So what do you want to play then ?  Blackjack.We can play blackjack . And I will gamble one-hundred , or maybe two-hundred dollars .  Huh ? You are breaking our rule already ! And we didn't even start to play yet !  Oh , don't be so strict ! We are in Las Vegas .  Yes , and if I stay with you , we will have to walk back home to New York.Because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too ! 
... so , I said , let ’ s take a break.And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ?  Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine .  You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ?  But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .  He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up .  Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright .  But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up !  You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ...  No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ...  do you hear something ? 
Why did she do that ?  I have no idea . It was completely out of the blue . 
Irene ! I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how how did it go ? I want all the juicy details !  Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing !  Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ?  He ’ s really good looking . he ’ s quite tall , around 61 , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ...  He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ?  You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him !  Hold on a sec , his name is David ?  Yeah ?  That ’ s my brother ! 
I ’ m so excited about Chinese New Year ! When do I get to visit Grandma ? Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world !  Ha ha , right . Sounds to me like you ’ re more excited about the dumplings than seeing your Grandma .  Of course I miss Grandma , too . I bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play Mahjong ! Hey , Dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? We ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! I ’ m really looking forward to lighting them !  Son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous !  No , fireworks are awesome !  Whoa , don ’ t you remember ? Last year when I set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ?  I was scared because ... because I saw a bug . That ’ s all .  Ahahah ... really ?  Oh , and I can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! Dad , can I sit on your shoulders this time ?  Hey , I offered last year ...  Well , I ... anyways , I was just thinking of the red envelopes . I wanna make a list of all the things I ’ m gonna buy with my red envelope money ! I can ’ t wait ! I ’ m gonna have so much money ! Mom , can I get a pen and a piece of paper ? I want a new transformer , no , two transformers ... the Optimums Prime , and ... maybe the wheeljack ? I ’ ll get a PSP game , ahahah , and I ’ ll buy the entire class lunch at MacDonald ’ s ... 
Has the game started yet ?  Yeah , about 5 minutes ago .  Who's winning ?  The Bulls , of course !  What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref !  Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws .  You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot !  That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah !  Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it !  This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that !  Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . 
I ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! I feel just awful about this whole thing . I wanna make it up to you . Let me take you out to dinner tonight . My treat .  That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address . Pick me up at eight ?  Perfect !  Thank you for such a lovely evening ! The food was amazing , and I had a great time .  Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ...  What is it ?  I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . 
So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet .  And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ?  Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food .  I ’ Ve heard this one before .  But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time !  Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see .  Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ? 
I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married !  Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years !  Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful !  Who are those kids walking down the aisle ?  That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute !  I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception .  That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous.Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ?  Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? 
Whoa , whoa , what ’ s going on ? Watch out !  Hey , watch where you ’ re going !  Oh , no ! I ’ m so sorry ! Are you all right ?  Oh ... I don ’ t know .  I feel terrible , I really didn ’ t mean to knock you over . My tire , just exploded , and I lost control of my bike . Really , it was an accident . Please accept my apologies .  Oh , wait a second , you seem really familiar , I think I know you from somewhere .  Yeah , I think we have met somewhere before . That ’ s right ! We met at Aaron ’ s place last weekend ! What a coincidence ! But anyway , I ’ m glad to see that you ’ re not too badly hurt , and I should probably get going . I have a nine o ’ clock meeting .  Ouch ! My ankle ! I think it ’ s broken ! You can ’ t just leave me like this ! Are you calling an ambulance ?  Nope , I ’ m canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you . 
What do you want to do tomorrow night ?  What--is tomorrow night something special ?  It's Friday . We should go party .  I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know .  Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing .  Do you feel like dancing ?  Yes ? Why not ?  Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends .  They aren't alcoholic !  No , maybe they're not . But they're close .  So where should we go ?  Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night .  You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar .  The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ?  It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night .  No . But they play techno all the time . It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow , if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps.At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . I know you .  It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ?  Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there .  No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa.Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch !  It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ?  Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do .  Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you ?  Maybe . 
Nick ! How ’ s it going ?  Oh , hey ...  What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ?  Actually , my office is right around the corner .  It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment .  Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion .  Sure , you still have my contact details , right ?  You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ?  Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . 
I heard you were teaching English over there.Tell me about it . Did you like it ?  Oh , yes , it was very interesting .  What were the schools like ?  Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes .  But you taught children , yes ?  Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school .  They actually study after school ?  That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there .  Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ?  Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough .  Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that .  So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention .  But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too .  As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience .  Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ?  That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too .  Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ?  I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing . So I really can't compare . 
How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ?  No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want .  I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot .  Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system .  I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much .  I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains .  It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars .  Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people .  Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change .  Why do you say " have to " ?  Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use .  Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important .  Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon . I have to get home .  Do you want me to give you a ride ?  No , no problem . I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner .  Alright.Well , I'll stay here and have another coffee . Nice running into you .  See you around . 
The hotel is full tonight . we will need to find a new place to stay .  Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . I've been wanting to try a new place anyway . 
Sorry I was late for the meeting today . I got stuck in traffic .  That's okay . Better late than never . 
Did it take you a long time to quit smoking ?  No . I just went cold turkey , and I never smoked again .
