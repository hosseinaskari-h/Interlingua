Could you baby-sit for me tonight ?  I'd be glad to . 
How did you get the piano here ?  It was hard work .  You never did it on your own .  It took three of us to move it . 
It sounds like Bob's getting out of bed .  What time did he come in last night ?  It was after 2 am .  Who was he out with ? 
Are you ready to leave ?  Give me a sec . 
Don't do that . You are asking for trouble .  I don't care . 
Shall we buy ?  It really depends on you .  But if you were me ?  If I were you , I'd buy . 
It's time to go to bed .  But mum , we're watching this movie .  I don't care , it's school in the morning .  Just 10 more minutes . 
What are you eating ?  Rice .  Why ?  Because it's supposed to be good for you . 
It's your turn to go first .  I went first last time .  No , Mary went first last time .  Oh , Okay . 
Shall we go out tonight ?  Yeah , let's go Joe's Disco .  We'd better ask dad first .  Okay , but you ask him . 
I'll cook dinner for you .  Don't go to too much trouble . 
Have you got any better ?  That's the best there is .  Okay , I'll take one .  That'll be $ 200 , sir . 
Let me help you with that .  Thanks very much .  You really shouldn't be lifting this by yourself .  I know , but there was nobody else . 
Let's eat out .  Why not ? 
Why aren't you going out ?  It's raining cats and dogs . 
What are you doing tomorrow ?  I'm going to work .  What time will you be home ?  Around 6 o'clock . 
What did you do today ?  Played poker with my work friends .  Did you win ?  Of course . 
Hang out the clothes .  But it's raining . 
Do you play mahjong ?  Once in a while . 
You stink !  I'll go take a shower .
