Good morning . What can I do for you ?  Well , I hate to disturb you , but I really can't stand it any more . Can you change my room for me ? It's too noisy . I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . It was too much for me .  I'm sorry to hear that . This room is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when everything is quiet .  Anyhow , I'd like to change my room .  I'm awfully sorry , Miss . I do apologize . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? A tour company will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .  All right . I hope I'll be able to enjoy my stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .  Be sure . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know .  OK . Thank you .  You're welcome . I hope you'll be more comfortable in your new room .

I'd like to make a reservation to Los Angels for next Monday .  Just a second and I'll check the schedule .  I'll need an economy ticket with an open return .  American Airlines has a flight leaving at 9:25 a . m .  I guess that's OK . What time should I check in ?  You have to be there two hours before departure time .

After you  Thank you !  What's the weather like in your country ? I suppose it must be warmer than here .  Oh , yes . We have rather mild winters . It always has much sunshine in winter . But it was very foggy when I left two days ago . I knew it would be colder here , but I thought there would be a lot of snow .  We don't have much snow in winter in Beijing . In fact , we haven't had any so far this winter . The winter is rather long , but the cold is generally not severe . The temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero Centigrade .  What is the temperature today , do you know ?  About freezing point , I think.But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero .  Oh , I'm very lucky that my wife let me take a heavy overcoat .  It is considerate of your wife .  Yes , she is . By the way , what is the best season in Beijing ?  Fall is the best season in Beijing . It's neither hot nor cold . The sky is clear and blue . There's hardly any wind , only a slight breeze which is hardly noticeable . And we have plenty of sunshine too .  Really ? Then I will come to Beijing in the fall next time .  Good , you are welcome .

Sure , and I'm glad to meet you . Thanks for your help . 
Yeah , look at all those new buildings going up ! Mr . Zhang , the traffic is pretty smooth . But we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour .  Yes , they were . But it has already past . The traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of Yan'an Aerial Road .  We've never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? I've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the States .  That's wonderful . OK . I'll remember that . But I have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for there're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people don't take road regulations seriously . 
Good evening , ma'am . May I help you ?  Yes . I'd like to use a safety deposit box .  Will the object fit into this size of box ?  Let me see . I think it's OK .

Is this the Friendship Hospital ? Please send an ambulance to 68 Hu Nan Road .  Is it urgent ? Our ambulances are not enough to meet every call .  Of course . It's urgent . I think the partie nt is suffering from acute appendicitis . He may die if not treated in time .  All right , we'll come right away .  ( after a while ... ) Where's the patient ?  He's there in the room . He's very ill .  Don't worry . We'll put him in the stretcher . You are coming with us ? Step in please .  Carry him into the emergency ward . Here we are .  Help the patient bathe and change his clothes , nurse . Then bring him into the operating room .  ( after a while ... ) I'm his guide . What's the trouble with him , doctor  He had appendicitis , but is all right now that it was removed . He'll have to rest for a few weeks to recover .  May I send food for him ?  No , outside food is not permitted .  Can I come round to see him tomorrow ?  Yes . But first you must observe the visiting hours , It's from 2 to 5 p . m .

I'm so glad we decided to go on a cruise for our vacation .  Are you even glad that we get to buy new clothes too ?  Ah , that's all part of the fun . What do you think of these shorts ?  They look really good on you . They look comfortable too .  They are . I think I'm going to get a hat too .  Okay . I chose this swimming suit . Do you like it ?  Wow . You look great .  Great and white ! Which reminds me , let's pick up some heavy duty sunscreen ! 
There's been a dramatic change in the weather pattern .  Don't tell me it affects our flight .  It has been delayed .  Did they say for how long ?  No , but probably until there is a break in the storm .  So we can't really go anywhere , can we ?  I think it's smart to stay close to the gate so we can hear the updates .  I brought some cards . Are you up for a long game ?
