“While the government’s new programme of family hubs is undoubtedly welcome, with the current rollout limited to 75 local authorities, it’s very difficult to see how the plans will compensate for the sheer scale of children’s centre closures that have taken place over recent years.”
A Labour spokesperson said: “The last Labour government transformed young lives, and if we’re privileged to form the next government, Keir Starmer’s changed Labour party will transform lives again.
“Our mission-focused Labour government will embark on a decade of national renewal, with reducing child poverty and expanding opportunity at its heart. With Labour, children will be the healthiest and happiest generation ever.”
A Department for Education spokesperson said expenditure on Sure Start at its peak would represent a quarter of current overall spending on early years thanks to the government’s huge investment in expanding childcare.
“We continue to invest in family hubs, which now cover half of all upper-tier local authorities and provide a number of advantages over the Sure Start model, including access to support up to when children turn 19 or 25 if they have special educational needs or disabilities, a wider range of support and an evidence-led focus on the crucial 1,001 days of a child’s life.”

We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory !  Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading  That is preposterous !  You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong !  I am not wrong ! The chicken came first !  No ! The egg came first !

I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last .  You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining . 
Would you travel around the world if you had the money ?  At the drop of a hat . 
What's bothering that guy ?  Nothing . He's just got a chip on the shoulder . 
Do you think you will ever work at that company again ?  When pigs fly ! 
That was a tough question . How did you get it right ?  I just took a shot in the dark . 
All of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and I'm going too !  Over my dead body you are ! 
How was your business trip ?  Great - they wined and dined us all week . 
Did you understand question number three ?  Not at all , I was totally in the dark . 
I never understand why these shops have so much liquor .  What do you mean ? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free .  But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor .  Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it .  You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ?  Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ?  No , I didn't . How high is the tax ?  Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal .  Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ?  Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it .  That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ?  Of course . Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily . 
Will you be at the family reunion next year ?  Yes , we'll be there , come hell or high water ! 
Hectic . It's always hectic . But how was your windsurfing ?  I tried it for a half-hour.It was interesting , but ... well ... I couldn't really do it .  See ? I told you . It's very hard .  I couldn't even stand on it and hold the sail . I probably fell down fifty times .  Fifty times ?  Yes , it was really stupid .  And how much did it cost to rent it ?  It was fifty dollars for a half-hour .  Well , that's not too bad then .  What do you mean ? It's expensive !  Yes , but you have to calculate a little.You paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times.So you only spent one dollar per fall . That's cheap . 
This place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ?  Yes . But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast .  What are you planning to do today ?  I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one .  Have you done windsurfing before ?  No , but it looks fun . I always wanted to try it .  Can you take a little advice from a friend ?  Sure . What ?  Don't waste your money . Windsurfing is very hard . And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall .  But I always wanted to try it .  Yes , but it takes a long time to learn.You would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer .  Well , I will see . How was your day at the office ?
