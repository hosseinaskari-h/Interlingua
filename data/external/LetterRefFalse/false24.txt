All I do all day is work and watch TV . I really should start thinking about my health .  I never thought about that , but you're right . What do you think we should do ?  For starters , we should start doing more outdoor activities . That way we'll get some exercise .  I was thinking about taking tennis lessons . I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon . What do you think about that ?  That's not a bad idea . How much is it ?  I heard it is only about one hundred twenty dollars a month for 8 lessons .  Playing tennis twice a week will be a good start . Count me in .

One of my students told me she was very depressed today .  Why ?  Her father is dying .  Oh , that ’ s very sad .  Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid .  What did you do ?  I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her .  That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things .  Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own .  Yeah , me too . 
Have you seen the movie Batwoman ?  No , not yet . Is it good ?  Yes , it's quite amusing , actually . Good plot , and Sharon Stone's in it .  Oh , she's good . She must be getting on a bit now .  Yeah , but she looks amazing .  So what's the movie about ?  Well , it's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . But then she got reincarnated as a cat .  Huh ?  I know . Stay with me . She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . First , though , she had to discover her true cat nature . At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone , who was the real danger in the company . She had actually murdered the boss , who was her husband , and then tried to frame Batwoman for the murder , so everyone thought Batwoman was evil .  I see . Batwoman married the boss ?  No . Sharon Stone was married to the boss , who treated her badly , so she killed him . So where was I ? OK , so then , at the same time she fell in love with a cop , who was investigating the murder of the boss . Finally , she ditched the cop to follow her feline nature .  Wait a minute , I'm lost . The cop killed the boss ?  No , Sharon Stone did .  And Sharon Stone is Batwoman ?  Haven't you been listening to a word I've been saying ?
