I wish it was a nicer day today .  That is true . I hope it doesn't rain .  It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer .  It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now .  It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather .  Any rain right now would be pointless .  That's right , it really would be .  I want it to cool down some .  I know what you mean , I can't wait until it's winter .  Winter is great . I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though .  I would rather deal with the winter than the summer .  I feel the same way .  I wish it was a nicer day today .  That is true . I hope it doesn't rain .  It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer .

Did you hear the news ?  What happened ?  Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week .  She did ? Why didn't anyone tell me ?  I would've thought that somebody would have told you .  No , I had no idea .  Well , she did , her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .  Oh my God , that's great !  Are you going to go and visit her and the baby ?  I think that I might .  Good ! I just thought I'd let you know .  Thanks for telling me .

That's good to hear .  Will you go and visit them ?  Of course I will .  I just wanted to give you the good news .  Thanks for letting me know . 
What a wonderful dinner !  Thank you . I am glad that you are enjoying it .  Where did you get your fantastic recipes ?  I grew up cooking . My mother shared her recipes with me .  I especially like the wonderful chicken dish .  That is a special coconut ginger chicken with rice dish .  Is that shrimp in the soup ?  Yes , do you like it ? I added a little extra lemon grass and some sea vegetables .  I am happy that the wine I brought for you works well with this meal .  Yes , thank you for bringing the wine . It really complements the meal . 
Hey George , how is your chicken ?  My chicken tastes all right , but it is pretty dry . How is your fish ?  My fish is pretty dry too .  It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh .  Yes , it seems that way to me also .  How are your vegetables ?  My vegetables are very soggy .  Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked .  I don't usually complain , but I think that we should mention this to the waiter .  I agree . Maybe they can bring us some better food . 
George , is your chicken OK ?  It tastes great , but it is really dry . Is your fish all right ?  My fish is very dry .  I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it .  That's exactly what I was thinking had happened .  Are your vegetables OK ?  The vegetables are kind of mushy .  So are mine . I think they left them cooking too long .  The food here is usually good , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is a problem .  I think that you are right . Maybe they can give us a free dessert or something . 
This is a great meal !  Thank you . I am glad that everything turned out so well .  Who taught you how to cook this well ?  I took a cooking class at the Culinary Institute .  Wow , what is in this chicken dish ?  Isn't that great ? That is coconut ginger chicken with rice .  Is the soup a shrimp soup ?  Yes , there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass .  I think I got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal .  I appreciate you bringing the wine . It goes well with the chicken . 
I really love this meal .  Thanks . I was hoping that you would all enjoy this meal .  Where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes ?  I got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a few of the recipes .  The chicken is out of this world !  I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice .  I was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup .  Yes , that soup has a shrimp base . I also added sea vegetables and lemon grass .  It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well with this meal .  I love this wine ! It goes very well with the chicken . 
Would you like some more coffee ?  No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .  Good luck finding the waitress !  The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ?  I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way .  Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .  So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .  How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?  I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .  I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .  I think that we should leave 10 % .  $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip . 
Do you want some dessert ?  No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ?  Where is our waitress anyway ?  Yes , the service hasn't been the best . Is that our waitress over there ?  I'll walk over and get the bill , since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon .  Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together .  So the bill is $ 36.00 .  How much do you think we should leave for a tip ?  My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip .  I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control .  Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service .  I agree . We will leave $ 3.60 for the tip . 
Does your chicken taste all right ?  The chicken tastes wonderful , but it is kind of dry . Is your fish OK ?  My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry .  It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us .  Yes , maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight .  Are your vegetables a little mushy ?  The vegetables seem to not be very fresh .  Mine aren't so good , either .  I usually enjoy the meals here , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal .  I think that we should let someone know . They will probably want to fix the problem . 
You look really nice today .  Thank you . I just got this outfit the other day .  Really , where did you get it ?  I got it from Macy's .  It's really nice .  Thanks again . You look nice today , too .  Thank you . I just got these shoes today .  Really ? What kind of shoes are they ?  These are called All Star Chuck Taylors .  I really like those . How much did they cost ?  They were about forty dollars .  I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair . 
Have you met the new girl ?  No . Have you ?  She's one of the prettiest girls at the school .  What does she look like ?  Well , she's quite short .  How tall would you say that she is ?  I would say she's only 5 feet .  What about her facial features ?  She has light brown eyes , absolutely beautiful .  I think I know who you're talking about .  Have you seen her ?  I think that I have . 
Would you like to order anything else ?  No , I'm good . All we need now is our check .  Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight , hasn't she ?  I think that is our waitress is over by the bar . Boy , the service has not been good this evening .  She doesn't appear to be headed this way , so I will go get the check .  Good . Just bring it back and we'll total it together .  Our total for dinner is $ 36.00 .  What do you think would be the right amount to tip ?  I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received .  I agree that it was bad service , but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job .  I believe that 10 % is just about right amount .  I think that a tip of $ 3.60 will be the right amount to leave . 
Have you seen the new girl in school ?  No , I haven't .  She's really pretty .  Describe her to me .  She's not too tall .  Well , how tall is she ?  She's about 5 feet even .  What does she look like , though ?  She has pretty light brown eyes .  I may know which girl you're talking about .  So you have seen her around ?  Yes , I have .
