How do you do ?  How do you do ?  My name is Jane Greenwood.Glad to meet you .  I'm Mary Smith.Nice to meet you , too . 
Mary sings much better than Susan , doesn't she ?  Yes.But Mary is no match for Susan in painting .  Maybe it's because Susan's parents are both painters . 
Plastic bags are widely used nowadays .  But they're hard to be disposed of .  In this aspect , I think , Pater bags have the edge on plastic bags . 
George speaks Japanese better than Frank .  Yet in writing , George has nothing on Frank .  Therefore , I hope they could help each other and learn from each other . 
Maria sings like a lark , doesn't she ?  Yes , she's almost equal to Celine Dion when she sings .  Maybe she'll make a famous singer in the future .  You can bet on that . 
Bob returned from Japan last week . You know that ?  Yeah . I met him yesterday.He ' s no longer the same young man as he was eight years ago .  I think so , too . 
You're going go Dresden for sightseeing ?  Yeah.And I'm going by bus .  I think a train journey is as fast as a bus journey .  But both my wife and I prefer taking a bus . 
Do you like travelling ?  Yes , I do .  Do you usually travel by bus ?  No , by train . I think it's much safer than bus . 
Mike , you're seventeen years old , right ?  Yeah , Why ?  You look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen .  You can bet on that . 
Yesterday I read hamlet.such a fantastic book !  You said it.No one can match Shakespeare in artistic talent .  I do agree with you . 
Sally , do you really need to go ?  Yeah.It ' s a must for me .  But don't forget to give me a ring .  I won't , mum . 
Darling , can't you stay for a few more days ?  I can't . I've got to attend a meeting in London .  I'm really going to miss you.Take care of yourself .  I will . 
I'm leaving now , mum .  Take care , sonny !  I will.Bye - bye !  Bye ! 
Have some more tea , George .  No , thanks . I've really got to go now .  Have a nice day !  You , too .

Thank you very much for your invitation .  It's a great honor to have you here , Mr.Brown .  I'd like to say goodbye to you .  I look forward to seeing you soon.Goodbye ! 
Oh , it's ten o'clock . I'd better go now .  Would you stay for another cup of coffee ?  No , thanks . I'll have to meet my friend at the airport . 
Both Bob and carl will become somebody in the future.Don ' t you think so ?  Yeah.But Bob's talent can't to be named on the same day with Carl's .  But Bob is more generous and ready to help .  We cannot judge a man totally by that . 
Julia and Anne have both taken dance lessons.They want to be famous dancer , I think .  Yet Julia is not a patch on Anne because she's not as diligent and clever as Anne .  I don't see much difference , anyway .
