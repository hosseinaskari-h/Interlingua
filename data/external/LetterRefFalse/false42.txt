A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year .  It ’ s horrible . Why do drivers run a red light then ?  Maybe they know they shouldn ’ t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ’ t pay enough attention to traffic lights .  Talking on the cell phone while driving is very dangerous too . It increases the chance of accidents .  I know . If a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined .
