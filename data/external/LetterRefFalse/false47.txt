Hey , Steven . What are you going to do this Saturday ?  If the weather is good , I'll go to climb mountains .  Are you going with your friends ?  No , I'm going alone .  Oh , aren't you afraid ?  Of course not . For me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby .  I think mountaineering is an exciting sport , but a little dangerous .  Yeah , you are right , but it's really interesting .

You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ?  Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful .  So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ?  Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .  Do you do the same exercises every day ?  No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .  Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?  It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them .  Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . 
Can I help you ?  Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here .  Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students .  I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer .  Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .  Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?  Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ?  History .  Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price .  Thirty percent ?  Yes .  Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?  Yes . It's an excellent system .  Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?  Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing .  I don't want Macintosh . I want PC .  I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment .  What ? Are you serious ?  Yes .  But nobody uses Macintosh !  That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ?  Yes , I'm from Taiwan .  Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used .  But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese .  There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple .  Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .  No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple .  Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .  You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . 
Gordon Brown, the former prime minister who first announced the Sure Start initiative as Labour chancellor in 1998, was among those urging the opposition leader to prioritise the early years last night.
He said: “The wilful destruction of Sure Start and the reductions of children’s benefits after 2010 has set back opportunities for millions of children’s futures. That’s why our country desperately needs a new Sure Start.”
Three former Labour education secretaries added their voices, among them David Blunkett, who said a reinvention of the policy was “crucial to the wellbeing of so many young people in the years to come”.
The pioneering Sure Start programme, which set up “one-stop shops” in disadvantaged areas, bringing early years, health and family support services under a single roof, is widely regarded as one of New Labour’s most popular and successful policies.
