It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts .  We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?  Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .  You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?  Sounds good . May I have a look ?  Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .  They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .  All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .  Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?  This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .  Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .  OK , I will wrap them for you . 
Is there anything I can do for you ?  Would you please show me that mural ?  Certainly . Here you are .  It looks so beautiful . How much is it ?  Four hundred yuan .  That's a bit more than I wanted to pay . Can you cut the price down a bit ?  I'm sorry . Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this .  Maybe you are right . OK , I'll take it .  Well , I'll have it wrapped for you .  Thank you . Here is four hundred yuan .  Thank you . Please come again . 
Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ?  There's some leftover pizza from last night .  Anything else ?  Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day .  Do I have any other choices ?  There might be some birthday cake left in the freezer .  Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers !  You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner ! 
You are looking really healthy lately . What are you doing differently ?  Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year .  Tell me about it . I'm interested .  Well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking .  Ha ! That's right . You used to smoke . I forgot !  When I kicked that habit , I found I had so much more energy . I started exercising .  At the gym ?  No . I like to be outside . I took up hiking and mountain biking . 
Yes ! I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever !  How did you finally do it ?  A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals .  Like snacking ?  You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ...  I get what you mean .  Instead , I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals .  I'm impressed . Good for you ! 
This book I'm reading about Yoga is really interesting .  I didn't know you did Yoga .  I don't really practice it regularly yet , I'm just learning about it .  What have you learned ?  Right now I'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly .  As opposed to short and shallow ?  Yes . It says here , ' He who only half breathes , half lives . '  I read something like that once . I think it was , ' Life is in the breath . ' 
Good evening , madam . May I help you ?  I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ?  Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin .  That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ?  We have half-hour and one-hour treatments .  What's the regular price ?  Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do .  Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up .  That's fine , madam .  By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please .  Yes , madam . 
Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?  I don't want to .  Well , come over and talk to me then .  Certainly not .  May I turn on the TV then ?  Turn on the TV , for what ?  So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .  Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?  I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .  To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . 
Where is your dressing room ?  Right over there .  ( Person A comes out of the dressing room ) How did you like the sweater ?  I loved it . I'll take it .  Great . I can ring you up over here . It comes to $ 87.04 .  Here you go ?  Do you have a credit card with us ?  No I don't .  If you open up a card , you can save 10 % on all your purchases today .  Not today . Thanks though .  No problem . We always have this offer , so when ever you decide to , just let us know .  Sure .  Is there anything else I can help you with ?  Yeah . I was looking at some of your pants , but they are all a bit too long . Do you have alteration services here ?  Yes . It cost $ 7 , and it takes one day .  Great . Thanks for your help .  Thank you , and have a great day . 
We have reservations for two at your restaurant tonight .  Yes , What can I do for you , sir ?  I'm calling to see if I can request a specific table .  I can try to arrange that for you .  I proposed to my wife in your restaurant and I would like the same table if I can .  Can you describe for me , where you were sitting ?  It was a little table by the bay windows overlooking the wharf .  You're in luck . We still have that little table . 
Hi . Can I help you with anything ?  Yeah . Can I look at this ring ?  Sure . Let me get it out for you . What is your size ?  I believe I am a six .  Here you go .  Would you have any necklace that would go well with this ?  Actually , we have a few to choose from . They are over here .  There's no price tag on this necklace .  Oh . I'm sorry . I'll check the price for you . It is $ 199 .  This necklace is a little short . Do you have one that is longer ?  Yes . Why don't you try this one on .  This one is much better . Can I try on the ring with this necklace ?  Sure . Here you go .  Let me think about it .  Sure . Take your time .  Thank you for all the help .  No problem at all . 
The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us .  Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ?  Hey , sis . You know me , if I don't like everything on the menu , I don't go back to the restaurant !  So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order ? In that case ...  Wait , you love salmon , don't you ? They have the best salmon pasta .  That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ?  Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back !  I see what you mean ! 
I've never been to a restaurant like this before .  It's really different , isn't it ?  That's a good word to describe it .  I hope you're hungry because the pizza here is huge as well as to die for .  I am hungry . I think I could eat a large by myself .  Well , let's order one for starters .  I'm in the mood for a Californian .  That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order . 
Dad , what are we doing tonight for fun ?  We're going over to Mrs . Smith's place to help her with her yard work .  Yard work ? I said ' what are we doing for fun ' , not work !  It will be fun . And besides , you'll be in the best company .  Dad . You're so cute . What do I need to do to help get ready ?  You could get the rakes and some shovels together and I'll put them in the car .  Jeans and a tee shirt , right ?  Yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool . 
Ah , here we are .  This is the place I was telling you about .  Would you like to sit near the window ?  Good .  Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?  Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either . 
What can I get for you today , sir ?  I would like a cup of decaf with cream and no sugar .  Would you like anything else with that ?  How fresh is that apple pie over there ?  Our pie is brought in fresh every day . And I can tell you it's delicious .  Okay , throw in a piece of that pie then .  Is this to stay or to go ?  I'm in a bit of a hurry today , so we'd better make it to go . Thanks for asking . 
Excuse me . Can I ask you a question ?  Sure . What is it ?  I don't know how to say it in English .  We call this a ' parking meter ' .  Oh , Thank you . But how do you spell it ?  P-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r . 
Would you mind giving me a hand ?  Okay , Bob , What is it ?  Help me hang up this picture , please . Would you hold it straight while I put in the nail ?  All right .  Now , hand me the hammer and those nails , please .  Yes , here you are .  There ! How does it look ? Tell me if I've got it straight .  Well , it's straight , but it's upside down I'm afraid . 
Mom , I want to get a motorcycle . Is that all right with you ?  You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ?  Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise .  I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition .  What's that ?  You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month .  And after that ?  After that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , I mean motorcycle . 
Did you hear about that accident on the 5 ? There was a sixty-two-car pile up .  No kidding ! When did that happen ?  Early this morning .  Oh , no .  Yeah . And a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . You can imagine what happened after that .  Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ?  The count is up to seven right now and several are in critical condition .  That's amazingly low for such a huge accident !
